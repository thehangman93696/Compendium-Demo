<p><span class="MW-Girl">Girl:</span> &ldquo;Mr. Wolf! Mr. Wolf!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="MW-Wolf">Wolf:</span> &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="MW-Girl">Girl:</span> &ldquo;Do you mind holding my basket for a second? I need to adjust my sandals.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="MW-Wolf">Wolf:</span> &ldquo;Uhhh, sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took the basket from her. She turned around and bent over to do her sandals. She&rsquo;s not wearing any underwear.</p>
<p>After doing her sandals, she stood up again and took the basket from me.</p>
<p><span class="MW-Girl">Girl:</span> &ldquo;Thank you so much, Mr. Wolf.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="MW-Wolf">Wolf:</span> &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome, little girl. I&rsquo;m curious, what are you doing in the woods alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="MW-Girl">Girl:</span> &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m going to visit grandma?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="MW-Wolf">Wolf:</span> &ldquo;Your grandmother?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="MW-Girl">Girl:</span> &ldquo;Yes. She lives in the middle of the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="MW-Wolf">Wolf:</span> &ldquo;Ok, fair enou-&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="MW-Girl">Girl:</span> &ldquo;She&rsquo;s kinda that way. So, you go left past that tree, then right, left again, and then right. Go right again, then left twice, weave through the trees, keep going straight, take a right, then a left, walk straight a bit more, and voila, it&rsquo;s a big house.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="MW-Wolf">Wolf:</span> &ldquo;Aha.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="MW-Girl">Girl:</span> &ldquo;Thank you so much, Mr. Wolf. I&rsquo;m so grateful that I bumped into you. These sandals have been bothering me for the whooooole way up to here. How can I repay you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="MW-Wolf">Wolf:</span> &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s unnece-.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="MW-Girl">Girl:</span> &ldquo;I would do anything to repay your kindness to me, Mr. big hairy wolf.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="MW-Wolf">Wolf:</span> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s ok, darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="MW-Girl">Girl:</span> &ldquo;Any. Thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="MW-Wolf">Wolf:</span> &ldquo;Your beautiful smile is all I would&rsquo;ve asked for.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="MW-Girl">Girl:</span> &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re such a gentlewolf. Thank you again. Byeeeee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hopped her way between the trees.</p>
<p>(20 minutes later)</p>
<p><span class="MW-Girl">Girl:</span> &ldquo;Grandma, why do you have a big dick?&rdquo;</p>
