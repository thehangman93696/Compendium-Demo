<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Hey.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />Oh, you&rsquo;re in a good mood today!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Milena, this joke has run its due.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />I swear to God, you&rsquo;re like a different person every day.</p>
${storyImageRecurring('school_hall')}
<p>Michael stood there, face in his palm, mimicking Milena&rsquo;s dramatic move. He turned, scanned for someone new to talk today. He hopes this doesn&rsquo;t become a habit. The school hall buzzed around him, students flowing like ants in a disturbed colony. Until something brushed against his forearm. Milena gasped behind him.</p>
${storyImageRecurringLeft('milena_hall3')}
<p>He spun around, catching Milena hiding her hands behind her back, eyes darting into the distance like she was hoping to find a better story to step into.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />What was that?</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />What was what?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Milena, what are you hiding behind your back?</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />Nothing. Let&rsquo;s just go to class.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Show me!</p>
<p>He demanded, resolute. Her reaction, swift and obedient, reminded him of Lauren yesterday during their workout. He hated that she lied to him, her acting like a child annoyed him, he hated this submissive mimicry. Now, Milena, a rebellious creative kid, wasn&rsquo;t supposed to bend so easily. If you wanted her to listen, you had to respect, admire, and entertain her, otherwise she ignored you.</p>
<p>But Michael was resolute not to let it pass by, he would know what she&rsquo;s hiding for him. Milena listened, stretching her right hand out like it was a damn command performance, exactly like Lauren. Inside her palm, a clear prism rested, the kind that looked too fragile to touch but too mesmerizing to ignore.</p>
${storyImageCenter('0')}
<p>The moment Michael touched it, the prism&rsquo;s clarity dissolved into a mix of black and blood-red. He shot Milena a disappointed look as she stepped closer, eyes locked on the darkening object.</p>
${storyImageRecurringRight('milena_hall')}
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Why did it turn crimson when I touched it?</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />This is an aura prism. It responds to strong emotions.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />My angel, you have no need for this silly stuff. You&rsquo;re a walking prism yourself.</p>
<p>Milena, the emotional radar, the one who read vibes like tarot cards, didn&rsquo;t flinch. Her scrutiny was relentless. Michael didn&rsquo;t get an immediate response. Milena was already busy examining Michael&rsquo;s hands, face and eyes.</p>
<p>Her piercing gaze is slicing through Michael&rsquo;s facade and digging deep into his innermost thoughts. That skill of hers was very impressive and also unsettling.</p>
<p>Milena had a pure heart. If she ever turned that skill to manipulation, Michael thought, the world would be at her feet. But now, she was just another kid trying to decode the mess of their teenage world.</p>
<p>Milena pulled out a pocketbook from her backpack, flipping through the pages with purpose. She settled on a page and read aloud.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />Crimson: Deeper passions, including love and desire, but it can also signal danger or provoke feelings of aggression.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Does that mean I&rsquo;m in love with you?</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />Either that or you&rsquo;re going to kill me.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Well, you know what they say. Prisms never lie. Where&rsquo;s my dagger?</p>
<p>Milena rolled her eyes at the simplicity of the joke. Michael pocketed the faulty prism and they walked towards their classroom.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />Mom is obsessed with these things. She has them hung by strings from the ceiling all around the house.</p>
<p>Milena, skeptic to her core, had her mother&rsquo;s superstitions ingrained but didn&rsquo;t believe a damn thing about them.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I wonder what color it it would turn to if we rub it against your mom&rsquo;s pa-</p>
<p>A sudden backhand to his chest jolted Michael.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Fuck! That was too hard.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />I told you not to talk about my Mom!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I should&rsquo;ve put my guard up. Ah, so the prism tried to warn me.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span> (chuckle)<br />Nah, it&rsquo;s because your love and desire showed up early today.</p>
${storyImageCenter('1')}
<p>He saw Gina by the classroom door, uncharacteristically early, clutching her notebook like a nerdy girl in a clich&eacute; movie, yet glowing with a weird attractiveness because of how happy and excited she was beyond the usual.</p>
${storyImageRecurringRight('milena_hall')}
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />Why is she so happy? Oh, I get it! First class is Ms. Roberts and she&rsquo;s gonna take our homework papers.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Yeah, did you finish it?</p>
<p>He had told Milena about what happened with Gina and jenny that night. Milena blabbered on Saturday about some problm she and Ned couldn&rsquo;t tackle together. Michael had offered help, but Milena saw it as a puzzle and enjoyed solving it with Ned, who was particularly obsessed obsessed with the problems.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />We didn&rsquo;t manage to solve those 2 problems, but hey 8/10 isn&rsquo;t bad, is it?</p>
<p>He had no idea. To him, the whole paper was pretty easy, but in a way, he had an unfair advantage.</p>

${storyImageCenter('2')}

<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />Good morning all. Did you enjoy your weekend?</p>
<p>Roberts decided today was all about last week&rsquo;s assignment. One by one, students submitted their papers and stood before the class to discuss their approach. Roberts asked them comprehension questions, they were all pretty easy, much easier than the problems on the paper. It proved Roberts gave the assignment as a classroom bonding activity, with the intent of helping students start new frienships or relationships if they were lucky enough.</p>
<p>It was also clear that everyone had taken this seriously. Everyone, even the jocks, submitted their answered papers and answered the verbal questions correctly, although Roberts had to sneakily feed answers to those who struggled at first.</p>
${storyImageRight('3')}
<p>Gina&rsquo;s turn came. She got up, gave Roberts her paper, and stood confidently in front of the class.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />Mmmm. Interesting. You solved the whole paper!</p>
<p>A couple ooh&rsquo;s and mmm&rsquo;s of curiousity and admiration resounded within the class. Roberts hadn&rsquo;t commented on any other student&rsquo;s papers up to Gina, and by the sound of it, it seemed that most students didn&rsquo;t manage to answer the whole paper. Some problems were too difficult and little time was given to work on them.</p>
<p>Gina&rsquo;s eyes scanned the whole classroom. She seemed to like the reaction she got from the crowd, the way she gazed in almost everybody&rsquo;s eyes, one by one, except that she wasn&rsquo;t bothered with Michael.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />Yes. It wasn&rsquo;t that difficult to be honest.</p>
<p>A chuckle went through the watching crowd. Even Roberts seemed to enjoy Gina&rsquo;s show of arrogance.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />I&rsquo;m amazed by this. Do you mind if I ask you a more difficult question than the other students? I honestly didn&rsquo;t expect this from you.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />(shrug) I don&rsquo;t blame you, to be honest.</p>
<p>Another ooh went through the class. I&rsquo;m sure Gina was just being direct with Ms. Roberts, but it did come off as a challenge.</p>
<p>Roberts challenged her with a tough question. Gina looked nervous all of a sudden, took a breath, tilted her head downward, put her hands together, and brought them to her chin, silently, for about 15 seconds, visualized the problem, then raised her head up, gazing at Roberts.</p>
<p>Gina delivered a perfect answer. The problem she was given looked complicated at first. A couple of brainiacs tried to pen it out before Gina even opened her mouth.</p>
<p>Gina stripped the problem to its core, explained Kenzie&rsquo;s approach to that kind of problem. She was quite nervous; her hands shook, her voice shaky too.</p>
<p>Gina clearly understood what she was talking about, her arguments and presentation them were flawless, yet Gina wasn&rsquo;t that comfortable sharing an idea that sounded her own. Not once in his life would Michael have imagined to see Gina so nervous.</p>
<p>The technique Gina used wan&rsquo;t her own, but the solution she gave required mental work and creativity. That solution was insofar Gina&rsquo;s creation. That, ladies and gentlemen, was Gina&rsquo;s first flash of brilliance in her whole life.</p>
<p>The class was in awe, mouths agape. Everyone was impressed, hell, even Michael was.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />You&rsquo;re right! Gina your solution is flawless!</p>
<p>A gasp went through the class.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />It sounds easy when you put it in simple terms.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />Gina, I&rsquo;m out of words. Where were you hiding that talent?</p>
<p>Gina shyly put her hands behind her back.</p>
<p>Can you believe that? Gina? Acting shy? This is unreal.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />Being cool doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t be smart, honey.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span> (tucking her hair behind her ear)<br />I&rsquo;ll think about it.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />It&rsquo;s a shame you had to be docked a mark for this assignment. You know what? If you&rsquo;ve answered the whole paper correctly, I&rsquo;ll give you 5 bonus marks.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />Thank you, Ms. Roberts. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll be impressed.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />I don&rsquo;t think I can be more impressed than this, to be honest. If you keep this up for the whole term and focus on all your classes, I assure you you&rsquo;ll get into the best college in this country and choose any career you want. I know this is your dream.</p>
<p>Gina glanced at Michael for the first time that class. Eyed him very fondly. She was grateful for him. Gina gave Roberts a small nod, returning to her seat.</p>
${storyImageLeft('4')}
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />Michael, it&rsquo;s your turn.</p>

<p>Michael moved to the front of the class.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />Where&rsquo;s your paper?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I didn&rsquo;t bring my paper. I forgot it at home.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />Hmmm. I never thought I&rsquo;d hear that from a highschool senior but here I am.</p>
<p>Scornful laughs sounded around the classroom. Roberts shushed them.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />That&rsquo;s fine. We all make mistakes. I won&rsquo;t penalize you for it, but you have to bring me your homework first thing in the morning. Otherwise, you and Gina will not receive any points and you will fail the assignment. No excuses.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Sure.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />I&rsquo;ll give you your question now. I expect you&rsquo;d impress me as much as Gina did.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />That&rsquo;s a big shoe to fill.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span> (chuckle)<br />You&rsquo;re right. Look, I&rsquo;ll ask you an easy one because I really want Gina to get the full points on this assignment. Does anyone mind that?</p>
<p>No one objected.</p>
<p>Roberts gave him an easy problem. By far the easiest question asked that class, but definitely not trivial. Michael stood there and thought about it for a whole minute. He heard a couple scornful sighs, some side chatter, and a contemptuous snicker for taking so long to answer such an easy problem. Every goddamn person in the classroom is a genius today it seems.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I&rsquo;m sorry Ms. Roberts, I don&rsquo;t even understand what this problem is about.</p>
<p>Silence fell upon the room. You could hear your breathing in that silence. Not only did the chatter and chuckles stop, it seemed like everybody stopped breathing all of a sudden. Roberts was stunned. The students switched gazes betwwen themsselves, Ms. Roberts, and of course the biggest idiot in class, Michael.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />Michael, to say I&rsquo;m disappointed in you is an understatement. Listen to me, honey...</p>
<p>He was embarrassesdb being called endearingly in front of his whole class. Roberts tried guiding him. Even stepped forward to the board, sketched some diagrams, and spelled out hints on what to do and say, just to pass the mark. An average first year student who had never heard of integrals might&rsquo;ve been able to connect the dots and give Roberts the answer she wanted to hear. Michael showed no sign of understanding the words coming out of her mouth.</p>
<p>Popularity -10</p>
<p>Contempt, disgust, rage. The atmosphere in the classroom changed. Every eye in the classroom was headed towards him. Michael switched his gaze between his classmates, didn&rsquo;t have time to look each the eye but he managed to acknowledge many of them, until Roberts him back to my seat.</p>
<p>He sat back down.</p>
${storyImageLeft('4')}
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />You and Gina fail the assignment. There&rsquo;s no need to review your paper, Gina, you won&rsquo;t be getting any points in this assignment.</p>
<p>Roberts angrily strutted to Gina&rsquo;s desk, returning the latter&rsquo;s papers. Gina sprung up and with a cracky, low-pitched, raspy voice, she complained...</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />Ms. Roberts this is unfair!</p>
<p>Gina was quite emotional.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />I will take no complaints. If any of you have a problem with me or my teaching methods, address your complaint to the Principal.</p>
<p>Roberts continued the testing. Other students came out, gave their papers in, and went through the cycle Gina and Michael had gone through, except that every single student gave their mostly solved assignment paper to Roberts and answered her question. Yes, even the most brick headed jocks passed.</p>
<p><br />Each student coming out after Michael, threw a dagger at the idiot with their eyes; John, Tommy, Shayne, Amanda, Joanna, Kyle, Timmy, Aaron, Kimmy, Shamika, Clarissa, Kelsi, Rick, and even the renegade angel Milena scowled at me.</p>
<p>The only two who had&rsquo;t bothered to eye him down were Jenny and Ned. The class came to an end soon.</p>

<p>CALVERT<br />This piece of verse is truly one of the most exquisite I have had the pleasure of laying my eyes upon. I would be delighted to engage in discourse regarding its artistry. Might any of you care to put forth a topic for discussion?</p>
<p>Nobody gave a damn.</p>
<p>CALVERT<br />In that case, may I humbly offer a point of discourse? Mr. Alexander, may I borrow your attention for a moment?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />You already have it, Ms. Calvert.</p>
<p>CALVERT<br />Thank you. How courteous of you! I&rsquo;m glad I do have your attention. Pray tell, what do you think of the poem.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I couldn&rsquo;t have said it better myself, Ms. Calvert, it&rsquo;s exquisite.</p>
<p>CALVERT<br />Wonderful. Now, what would you say the major difference between Edgar Alan Poe&rsquo;s The Raven and T. S. Eliot&rsquo;s The Hippopotamus is?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />The difference between The Raven and The Hippopotamus?</p>
<p>CALVERT<br />Yes, Mr. Alexander, the difference between today&rsquo;s poem and the one we discussed last Friday in class.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I wasn&rsquo;t here on Friday, ma&rsquo;am.</p>
<p>CALVERT<br />Oh, weren&rsquo;t you? I never seemed to notice it. I&rsquo;ll excuse you, Mr. Alexander, there must be a very important reason you didn&rsquo;t come to school on Friday, but surely you&rsquo;ve reached out to your colleagues to inquire about the classes you missed.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I didn&rsquo;t, Ms. Calvert, and I have no excuse for that.</p>
<p>CALVERT<br />How preposterous! Don&rsquo;t you have any shame, Mr. Alexander! How could you be so careless? Where&rsquo;s your sensibility?</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have a response to that.</p>
<p>CALVERT<br />Oof, I&rsquo;ll let it pass by, it&rsquo;s not the first or last time you&rsquo;ll disappoint me, Mr. Alexander, but I can&rsquo;t ever get myself to get used to it. Nevertheless, I&rsquo;ll let it pass. Let&rsquo;s discuss, you and I, today&rsquo;s poem, shall we?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I would like you to propose a point of discussion, Ms. Calvert.</p>
<p>CALVERT<br />How very nice of you? I propose this topic of discussion, Mr. Alexander. Why is the narrator insane?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I&rsquo;m sorry?</p>
<p>CALVERT<br />I repeat: Why is the narrator of The Raven insane?</p>
<p>There was tension in the air all around me. I saw a couple of necks turning to look at me, and for the second time today I was a blackhole that sucked everybody&rsquo;s enjoyment of the class, and in turn, attracted hate and resentment.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />One more time, Ms. Calvert.</p>
<p>CALVERT<br />Mr. Alexander! Why is the narrator of The Raven, the poem we finished reading just 3 minutes ago, in your<br />own opinion, insane?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Ms. Calvert.</p>
<p>CALVERT<br />Mr. Alexander, can you hear me?</p>
<p>The tension was thick, and he felt like a pariah. No one dared speak without Calvert&rsquo;s permission in her presence, but he could hear the aggressive shout &ldquo;Get on with it, man!&rdquo;&ldquo; echoing through his mind.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I would like you to state the question one more time, Ms.Calvert. Rephrasing it is unnecessary.</p>
<p>CALVERT<br />Why. Is. He. Insane?!!!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Nope. Not quite my tempo.</p>
<p>A loud cackle shook the walls of the classroom. Everyone turned to Jenny who fell into a fit of hysterical laughter.</p>
<p>Calvert and Michael locked eyes during Jenny&rsquo;s laughter, a stare-off until the giggles subsided. She didn&rsquo;t understand the reference, she assumed it was an insult. Jenny&rsquo;s hysteria ended half a minute later. For 30 long seconds, Calvert&mdash;tongue pressed in cheek and squinting, eyed Michael like he was the devil, while Jenny laughed her heart out, banged on her desk, shut her mouth by the might of her own hands, and burying her head between legs, until finally the fit came to an end.</p>
<p>Unamused by his jest, Calvert shot back.</p>
<p>CALVERT<br />Ooh la la, one is a mute and the other deaf.</p>
<p>Michael furiously slammed his fist onto his desk, springing to his feet.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Shut your damn mouth!</p>

<p>Backpack in hand, he stormed out of the classroom.</p>
<p>Michael stood in the hall, wondering what to do till next class. He&rsquo;d wish to leave school now but they won&rsquo;t let him before the end of 
the day. He linger, his confusion not lasting long. Soon, his name sounded through the speakers in the halls.</p>

<p>Roberts didn&rsquo;t utter a single word since his entrance to the office. Her unwavering gaze locked on him&mdash;a look of disappointment and, if you can believe it, disdain as well in her eyes.

<p>He had nothing to say. Funny, he found himself glancing at the Principal for sympathy. None was given. He returned<br />to Roberts.</p>

<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Alright, there&rsquo;s no reason to talk then. You can&rsquo;t expel me, I did nothing that deserves expulsion; detention maybe, or suspension, or any kind of punishment, but definitely not expulsion! I didn&rsquo;t kill anybody!</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />We&rsquo;re saving your time and ourselves the trouble, Michael. The way you&rsquo;re treating your studies tells me you&rsquo;re not gonna pass this year.

And when I tried to reason with her and tell her that we are a strict school and that this was the first incident where a student missed school for a reason that was not beyond their control in YEARS, she refused to speak to me.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Yeah, Mom is a very busy woman, she must&rsquo;ve not had the time.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />Oh, I assure you she had the time. Because she had a long talk with the principal.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />What?</p>
${storyImageRight('colette_office')}
<p><span class="Colette">COLETTE</span><br />Your mother demanded to speak with someone with authority immediately, Mr. Alexander!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Why?</p>
<p><span class="Colette">COLETTE</span><br />Your mother is a very very difficult customer, Mr. Alexander.</p>
<p>He wondered why Mom would give them trouble?</p>
<p><span class="Colette">COLETTE</span><br />I talked with your mother for 2 hours straight on the phone on Friday. She was very critical of our school system. She argued that there was a great disparity between your progress in school and your sisters. Kenzie and Kelsi are top students of their class each year and she said that all her children were very smart and that there must be something wrong in our school that hindered your progress, Mr. Alexander.</p>
<p><span class="Colette">COLETTE</span> (cont&rsquo;d)<br />Out of respect to your mother, I decided not to mention Mandy and I started explaining our disciplinary system and our policies and I went into extreme detail to show her why they work and how they&rsquo;ve been tested on thousands of other students. Your mother wouldn&rsquo;t listen and she iterated that a student who cared about their education would never miss a day of school unless the school gave him the impression that he can get away with it.</p>
<p><span class="Colette">COLETTE</span> (cont&rsquo;d)<br />She argued that a school system can only be judged by its ability to engage intelligent students and discipline those who misbehave, and so our school system must be flawed. She warned that if we don&rsquo;t improve- if we failed to put you, Mr. Alexander, at the top of your class, no, on top of the whole school even, by the end of the year, she would personally come here and show us how it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p><span class="Colette">COLETTE</span><br />Now, I&rsquo;ll be honest with you, Mr. Alexander, everything your mother said was absolutely true. Except for one thing, you do not care about your education. I was shocked to find myself talking to a parent about a student&rsquo;s attendance myself, and I was even more astonished to find myself on the defensive side of that conversation. I will not allow myself and my school to be insulted and ridiculed by a careless parent who doesn&rsquo;t even know the capabilities and the behavior of their own children.</p>
<p><span class="Colette">COLETTE</span> (cont&rsquo;d)<br />Before I ended the call with your mother, I asked if she wouldn&rsquo;t mind us being strict with you as she wished, and she told me she wouldn&rsquo;t mind whatever punishment we put you through, no matter how harsh or unfair it is.</p>
<p><span class="Colette">COLETTE</span> (cont&rsquo;d)<br />Mr. Alexander, since day one of this school year, not a single school day has passed without you causing trouble, and we have no reason to think that this pattern will change anytime soon. Now, given that we have no hope of you taking your education seriously, that we&rsquo;re eager to prove that our school system is top-notch and without fault, given our desire to deter other students from imitating your behavior, and having verbal consent from your mother on a recorded call to punish you severely, we have decided to place upon you the harshest possible punishment for your actions...</p>
<p><span class="Colette">COLETTE</span> (cont&rsquo;d)<br />Expulsion.</p>
<p><span class="Colette">COLETTE</span> (cont&rsquo;d)<br />Mr. Alexander, you are no longer a student of this school.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Alright. I guess I have no way of talking myself out of this. I will take my bag and leave now.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Can I say something before I go?</p>
<p><span class="Colette">COLETTE</span><br />Go ahead.</p>
${storyImageLeft('jen_office')}
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Ms. Roberts, I&rsquo;m sorry. When I came into this room and heard that I was being expelled, I thought it was a cruel joke. As I listened to your reasons for expelling me, I started to accept the reality of this situation. I am certain now that I will never walk into this school again, and I&rsquo;m very sorry for that.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span> (cont&rsquo;d)<br />I&rsquo;m not sorry for the troubles I caused you. I&rsquo;m not sorry for hitting on Gina, bullying Jenny, kissing the new teacher&rsquo;s hand, missing school, or forgetting my homework. I&rsquo;m certainly not sorry for calling Ms. Calvert a bitch.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span> (cont&rsquo;d)<br />I&rsquo;m not sorry for disappointing you. I have no passion for Mathematics and never did. I only acted otherwise to impress you. I always wanted to be a photographer, and I will be a great photographer. You have come to an irreversible decision and I have come to an undeniable conclusion:<br />I don&rsquo;t need school.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span> (cont&rsquo;d)<br />I don&rsquo;t need college either. I wanna be an artist. No, I am an artist. My dream isn&rsquo;t to get a degree from a college! My dream isn&rsquo;t to be employed by a company. My dream is to capture beauty. Who can teach me that? Sure, I could&rsquo;ve learned a lot in college, but I guess I&rsquo;ll have to learn it the hard way- the real way, by going out there. I&rsquo;ll roam every inch of this earth and I&rsquo;ll capture and record the beauties of this world with my camera, and more importantly, with my eyes.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span> (cont&rsquo;d)<br />The real question is: Who can stop me from that?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span> (cont&rsquo;d)<br />Not you, Ms. Roberts, or you, Principal Colette, or anybody!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />In fact, by removing me from school, you saved me 5 years of my life I could&rsquo;ve wasted between school and college. Today is a sad day, but I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll reflect on it many years later and see it as one of the most important days of my life. Thank you for your decision. One day I&rsquo;ll become a famous photographer and you&rsquo;ll be proud that you have helped me become what I truly wanted to be.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span> (cont&rsquo;d)<br />I&rsquo;m only sorry for this, Ms. Roberts, that I won&rsquo;t see you again.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span> (cont&rsquo;d)<br />I&rsquo;m not saying this as a student to a teacher, I&rsquo;m no longer a student. I&rsquo;m saying this as a man to the most beautiful woman his eyes have seen.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span> (cont&rsquo;d)<br />One day I&rsquo;ll have captured the marvels of this world with my camera, but I will never capture the first one I&rsquo;ve seen: You.</p>
<p>He stood up, carrying his backpack on his shoulder.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Goodbye.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />Sit back down in your seat!</p>
<p>He sunk immediately.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />Michael, you are the most stubborn, most narrow-minded, and the rudest student I&rsquo;ve ever seen. I&rsquo;ve never seen a student like this. No! I&rsquo;ve never seen a man or woman act like this. You are just like your mother! You find a way to put yourself on top even in the most hopeless situation. It&rsquo;s unbelievable! Can&rsquo;t you just take the lesson and shut up!</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />Listen, young man! You&rsquo;re not leaving this school. Do you understand me?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Yes, ma&rsquo;am.</p>
<p><span class="Colette">COLETTE</span><br />But, Jen-</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />No if&rsquo;s and&rsquo;s or but&rsquo;s!</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />You will study your lessons, listen to your teachers, and you&rsquo;ll be nice and gentle to your fellow students. Am I clear?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Yes, ma&rsquo;am.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />I&rsquo;ll put you on a close monitoring program where every teacher has to report your behavior and progress class by class, every single class. I won&rsquo;t take anything less than what your mother would, Michael, you will end this year as the top student in this school.<br />Do you accept that?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I don&rsquo;t know Ms-</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />Your future is yours after that, but this year, you&rsquo;re a student. You will never skip a school day again. If the morning bell ever rings and you&rsquo;re not seated in the middle of your classroom, I swear I&rsquo;ll go drag you out of your mother&rsquo;s bed myself.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />That was unn-</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />And you dare not curse at a teacher as you did with Ms. Clavert. Don&rsquo;t you dare kiss a teacher&rsquo;s hands like you did with Ms. Robin, or ever talk to a woman like you just talked to me right now. Or I&rsquo;ll smack your silly tongue out of your face!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Not any woman, ma&rsquo;am?</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />I mean, don&rsquo;t ever talk to a teacher like that!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Yes, ma&rsquo;am. I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />Get out! Back to your class!</p>
<p>He got up, backpack on shoulder, and turned to leave.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />Hey, sit down!</p>
<p>Sat down again.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />Before you go, I wanna know something. Did you really forget your assignment paper at home?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I-</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />Don&rsquo;t lie to me!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />What difference does it make, Ms. Roberts? I already failed the assignment.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />I know you helped Gina with her homework. Why are you trying to make her fail?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />It&rsquo;s not like that.</p>
<p>Her voice, sharp and strong, suddenly became warm and caring...</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />Did she hurt you?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />It&rsquo;s not about Gina, Ms. Roberts. It&rsquo;s about you.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />Shut the hell up! Get out of my office!</p>
<p><span class="Colette">COLETTE</span><br />Jen, this is my office.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />I said get out!</p>
<p>Roberts was on fire. Aggressive and passionate above like never but in an her ever effeminate way. She was trying to be firm and strict and tried her damn best to curb the smiling but Michael saw it in her eyes. This time he was quick out of the office before anyone called for him again.</p>

<p><span class="Colette">COLETTE</span><br />You&rsquo;ll have to talk to Casey.</p>

<p><span class="Colette">COLETTE</span><br />Potential as a what?</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />Potential for Maths! The boy&rsquo;s a genius! And he wants to be a photographer?!!</p>
<p><span class="Colette">COLETTE</span><br />I thought you meant potential as a man.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />Oh... No... He was in a bad spot and he was trying to make an emotional appeal.</p>
<p><span class="Colette">COLETTE</span><br />He looked quite honest to me.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />I&rsquo;ll have you know this family is very manipulative. You saw what his mother is like. You should see his younger sister.<br />The little devil scares me.</p>
<p><br /><span class="Colette">COLETTE</span><br />Alright, I&rsquo;ll leave them all to you. I don&rsquo;t have time for this. Just... don&rsquo;t get too excited.</p>

<p>He reentered the classroom, greeted by silent scorn. He&rsquo;s probably the most hated guy in class right now. That&rsquo;s what bothered him.</p>
<p>Calvert was startled when he reentered the classroom. She had demanded that Michael were to be kicked out of school when she barged into Principal&rsquo;s office and revealed what he&rsquo;d done.</p>
<p>Anyhow, she didn&rsquo;t remark on his reentrance to class. He had knocked on the classroom door twice, swung the door open gently, stepped in, and politely asked to come back in. Calvert was civil to meet his politeness with a nod, albeit absolutely disgusted with him she didn&rsquo;t request an apology, and so Michael sheepishly walked to his seat avoiding the indignant eyes. This was the second class he ruined that day and there was no sign of him being punished for it, that until 5 minutes later the announcement resounded from the speaker in every class inside the school.</p>
<p><span class="Colette">COLETTE</span><br />Attention teachers and students!</p>
<p><span class="Colette">COLETTE</span> (cont&rsquo;d)<br />This is an announcement to inform everyone that the student Michael Alexander in Third Year class A is under strict surveillance. If anyone experiences any form of disrespect or rudeness from this student, whether directed towards themselves, another student, a teacher, or a staff member, please report it immediately to the Principal for further action. It should be noted that any behavior similar to Mr. Alexander&rsquo;s towards others will result in severe consequences, possibly leading to immediate and non-negotiable expulsion from the school.</p>
<p><span class="Colette">COLETTE</span> (cont&rsquo;d)<br />In addition to the student, we will also monitor their close friends and siblings until they show no signs of replicating Mr. Alexander&rsquo;s behavior. This decision is final and we will not accept any complaints regarding it. We hope you have a great day.</p>
<p>Popularity -150</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>The atmosphere changed from eerie to cheerful. Not a damn soul in the classroom doubted the faults in Michael&rsquo;s actions. Those who found his behavior amusing knew it was dangerous, uncool. The anxious ones, distressed by his aggression and cynicism, were now certain he wouldn&rsquo;t show them again anytime soon. His outburst was a monumental screw-up. He gained nothing from expressing his anger, only caused his friends troubles and himself losses.</p>
<p>He lost his serenity, his indifference. Now, inside the school, he had to watch his words, his actions, so he wouldn&rsquo;t accidentally offend any dummy, and had to pay closer attention to his studies. He lost his image. Soon, he might lose the company of his friends. Did he give a damn? He did. School wasn&rsquo;t worth a minute without Milena by his side.</p>
<p>On the surface, Michael was sitting there colder than ever. Inside, he regretted every single thing he did that day. Funny, he&rsquo;s missing Sunday for 
once.</p>

<p>He stood in the hall alone at the end of the day. Milena wouldn&rsquo;t stick by him, wouldn&rsquo;t be monitored by the school staff, the gossipers, the nosey-parkers, he thought. Lonely walks home from now on.</p>

${storyImageRecurringCenter('jenny_hall')}
<p>As he was about to leave, he noticed Jenny standing near her locker, holding her hands in front of her. She stole a couple of glances 
at his feet, contemplating approaching him but too scared to do it. He approached her himself.</p>
<p>He threw his backpack on the ground next to Jenny&rsquo;s feet, towering over her short body, and spoke sharply but not too aggressively.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />What was that about?</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />I- I- wanted to apologize.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Apologize for what?</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />I couldn&rsquo;t stop laughing.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />You liked that joke didn&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>The "Not quite my tempo" joke he told Calvert, after making her repeat herself many times, was a famous line from the first Whiplash movie. No wonder Jenny liked it so much. It was surprising she was the only one who caught the reference. Her thunderous cackling throughout the classroom, in front of an angry Calvert, was a joy to hear and watch. He never made anyone laugh so hard. But why did he feel like punishing Jenny for it?</p>
<p><br />Jenny was staring at her feet. When he threw his backpack next to her, she was startled, dropping her head lower, shaking from the coldness of his presence, the darkness of his shadow.</p>
<p>When he asked if she enjoyed his joke, she lifted her head, stared into his eyes, and nodded once.</p>
<p>It was the second time she looked into his eyes inside school. He wished he were the first person to look into her hypnotizing eyes within these old walls, but he never got the chance to confirm his suspicions. He missed those vibrating eyes. The feeling he got when he first looked at them in the dark auditorium on Thursday was back, more intense, and he still didn&rsquo;t know if he liked it or not.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />You put me in a lot of trouble.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />I&rsquo;m so sorry.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />That won&rsquo;t cut it. What do I do with your apoplogy after they kick me out of school?</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />I- I...</p>
<p>She dropped her head again, covering her eyes with her palms, like she was going to cry.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Do you hate me that much Jenny?</p>
<p>She looked at him again. He breathed.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />No, no, no, never.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Then why did you do that?</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />I didn&rsquo;t mean to, it was a mistake.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />A mistake? And how will you correct it?</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />I can... apologize to the Principal.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I don&rsquo;t care about the Principal. I only care about myself. You have to apologize to me first.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m very sorry.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I don&rsquo;t take words for apologies. You have to make it up to me.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />H-How?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I didn&rsquo;t get to see Whiplash 2 because of you. You know I can&rsquo;t stand being in the cinema alone, and you decided to run away at the best part and ruin it for me. I don&rsquo;t have anyone else to watch the movie with. I have to take you to the cinema again.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />When?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Tonight! I can&rsquo;t wait to see it!</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />I- I don&rsquo;t have any money.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Me neither. We&rsquo;re gonna have to steal some money.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />No no no no no no, never ever ever ever we can&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s wrong!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />And what you did to me today and on Thursday wasn&rsquo;t wrong? Not only did you ruin two days of my life, you ruined the whole year for me!</p>
<p>She found no words to say.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I&rsquo;ll pick you up at 5. Wear something fancy.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />Why?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Because it&rsquo;s our first date.</p>
<p>Jenny smacked her cheeks with both palms, covered her eyes, shook her head vigorously, letting out a suppressed groan like she was holding back a<br />scream. He turned around to leave.</p>

<p>He headed towards the school door, but this school day wasn&rsquo;t ending so soon. An angry Gina approached him.</p>

<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />Stop there, asshole!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />What do you want?</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />Why didn&rsquo;t you answer Ms. Roberts&rsquo; question?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I didn&rsquo;t know the answer.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />You&rsquo;re a liar! You and I know quite well that you could answer an easy question like that. Why did you make me fail?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Good question. Why would I do that to you?</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />That&rsquo;s unfair! I didn&rsquo;t do anything to you.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Can we talk about this later? You look unusually emotional today. I don&rsquo;t have time for this. Besides, my tongue is tied inside the school walls. I&rsquo;m not allowed to show anyone disrespect, and you know how difficult that is for me.</p>
<p>He tried to walk away. She stood in his way, shoved her fists into his chest, pushed him back. He stopped.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />No, you&rsquo;re not going anywhere. You and I are going to Ms. Roberts right now and you&rsquo;ll answer all her questions.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />How can I answer something I don&rsquo;t know the answer to?</p>
<p>Gina put her right hand on her chest, right above her heart, and appealed to him softly.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />Michael, I&rsquo;m sorry. Please, I need this.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />It&rsquo;s out of my hands now. Ms. Roberts&rsquo; decision is final.</p>

<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />Okay. But if you have an ounce of decency, please tell me first. Why? What do you gain from doing this to me?</p>

<p>Before he knew it, he was slammed into the locker to his right. Rick approached from behind. He must&rsquo;ve been watching, listening to the whole conversation with Gina. Not sure why he waited to attack, maybe Gina asked him to wait until her suspicion was confirmed. He restored his balance, stared at the enraged jock in front of him.</p>

A manipulative succubus, an obnoxious jock, and an experienced fighter. For the thousandth time today, he was on the losing end of a situation he could&rsquo;ve easily avoided.</p>
<p><span class="Kelsi">KELSI</span><br />You&rsquo;ll never change.</p>

<p>The hall felt quiet a minute ago, now it felt busy. Most students had left already, but given that he was the center of attention, the few lingering students felt like a crowd.</p>
<p>Jenny was one of them. A couple of minutes ago, she had trouble keeping her eyes on his, now she couldn&rsquo;t take them off.</p>
<p>Why couldn&rsquo;t she look away like always? He didn&rsquo;t want her to see this.</p>
<p>Did he care about Jenny? Absolutely not. He liked teasing her a lot though. He didn&rsquo;t want her to see him get beaten by Kelsi or Rick or anyone.</p>
<p>How could he tease her after this? How could he be obnoxious and crude to her again? Every time he annoyed her, the image of him writhing in pain would flash in her head and console her. The thought that he was picking on her to comfort himself would unconsciously run through her mind.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d take Kelsi&rsquo;s punch anytime, any place, in front of anyone, except for the one he enjoyed harassing.</p>

<p>He snatched another quick look at Jenny, standing behind Gina, trembling with disbelief. The guy who repeatedly bullied and taunted her was not what he seemed. Suddenly, he didn&rsquo;t look that big, not that tall, not so powerful. The boy who always proudly towered over her would now be beaten down to a size smaller than her. She&rsquo;d never be anxious in his presence again.</p>
<p>His mind raced for a way to escape, but he couldn&rsquo;t imagine any. The more he thought about it, the more certain he was that he&rsquo;d receive that punch. He felt depressed until he realized this:</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t care about Jenny, Gina, the school, or his education. He couldn&rsquo;t wait to see Lauren again.</p>
<p>Which stage of grief was this?</p>
${storyImageRecurringRight('kelsi_hall')}
<p>So, he returned his eyes to the hangman, looked her dead in the eye. He stood up straighter, raising his chest high, sticking his nose to the sky. He dropped his hands to his side, pulled them back, and knotted them behind his back. He took a deep breath. With a smirk, he gave his last words on Death Row...</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Give me all you got, bi-</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t finish. Kelsi&rsquo;s thunderous punch zapped through his guts, taking away his ability to utter anything but animal sounds. He let out a loud grunt, fell to the floor holding his stomach.</p>
<p>The crowd quickly disbanded. Gina, Rick, and their friends walked away after throwing a couple of insults. The other kids roaming the hall left too. He was lucky enough not to receive any direct comments from them. Even Jenny ran away. Kelsi stayed, watching him try to make sense of the pain in his stomach.</p>
<p><span class="Kelsi">KELSI</span><br />Why couldn&rsquo;t you just shut the fuck up? Do you wanna get expelled?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Ahahahaha. Ughhhh. I tried to but I can&rsquo;t. You know what they said to me today?</p>
<p><span class="Kelsi">KELSI</span><br />What?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />That I always have to be on top. Just like my mom.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span> (cont&rsquo;d)<br />You get it? Because Mommy&rsquo;s always on top. Ahahahaha. Ughhhh!</p>
<p><span class="Kelsi">KELSI</span><br />You sick fuck.</p>
<p><span class="Kelsi">KELSI</span> (cont&rsquo;d)<br />I honestly don&rsquo;t care what happens to you, but Mom will get mad if they kick you out of school. I&rsquo;ll be watching you.</p>
<p>Kelsi walked away while he stayed on the floor, laughing like a maniac, until an angel stopped him.</p>

<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />What are you doing?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />You know what they told me today?</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />No, I don&rsquo;t wanna know. Get up.</p>
<p>Milena gave him her hand, helped him up.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Please take me to heaven.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />Michael, we can&rsquo;t fool around school anymore. I just talked to the Principal and told her that I didn&rsquo;t want any trouble and she said I won&rsquo;t be monitored if I wasn&rsquo;t to be seen with you. I&rsquo;m sorry, I won&rsquo;t be talking to you inside school again until they take you off the surveillance program.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />So why are you talking to me now?</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />I want Mom&rsquo;s prism back.</p>
<p>He put his hand in his pocket, felt the cold and slick glass, and handed Milena her prism back. The thing still gleamed in that dark crimson shade. But as soon as Milena touched it, the color faded away, as if it knew its home was with her.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I guess it&rsquo;s goodbye then.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />Aha, this is definitely the time for drama.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Can I say some last words?</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />Impress me.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Happy birthday!</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />It&rsquo;s still too early for that. My birthday&rsquo;s tomorrow.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I know. But this is my last chance to say it to you.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />*giggling* We&rsquo;re still friends, dummy! We just can&rsquo;t talk inside school for a while.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />What am I gonna do with the gift I bought for you? *resting my forehead on my palm*</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />Oh, no, you did not buy me a gift. You&rsquo;re just trying to make me feel bad.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Only if you knew what I got for you.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />Look. I&rsquo;ll think about it. You know when I talked to the Principal, she cringed every time I said your name. Why<br />do they hate you so much?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Did you refer to me as Michael or Mr. Alexander?</p>
<p>Milena&rsquo;s eyebrows shot up at his question, a mix of surprise and suspicion.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />I was trying to distance myself as much as possible from you so I called you Alexander.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />It&rsquo;s not me that she hates. She&rsquo;s cringing at the thought of Mrs. Alexander.</p>

<p>They walked out of school together, the trees casting long shadows over their heads, blending with their conversation. He told her about the talk with his mom on Friday morning, about the tense phone call between her and the Principal...</p>

<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />Your mom is such a Karen. You brought it upon yourself though.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Oh so I tease her and she gets back at me by ruining my whole school year? I could&rsquo;ve been expelled for fuck&rsquo;s sake!</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />Well, I&rsquo;m sure she didn&rsquo;t mean to.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />That&rsquo;s even worse. I&rsquo;ll never speak to her again.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />Anyway, let&rsquo;s talk about the important stuff. What the fuck is wrong with you, dude?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />What?</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />What?!!! You got a dream opportunity with Gina and you threw it all away!</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span> (cont&rsquo;d)<br />I&rsquo;ll never forget her face when she was standing in front of the class, explaining that genius solution to the problem. Good job by the way. Give my compliments to Kenzie, mwah, that solution was awesome! I&rsquo;m sure Gina liked that solution too. She was standing there so happy and proud. This was probably the best day of her life. And she stood there and looked at you, so gratefully, her eyes are raining you with thanks and kisses...</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />And then it&rsquo;s your turn. She waits for you to come out and take her place. &rdquo;Oh my knight in shining armor, I&rsquo;m a flower in your hands&ldquo;, and then you stand up and stride towards the sexy flower, menacingly, oh you looked scary, I saw the evil intent in your eyes, more strongly I felt it in my guts, I knew something bad was gonna happen, and then coldly you approach your flower and BAM! You stomp her with your foot.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />My weekly dose of k-drama came early this week.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />Look. You&rsquo;re picking on the wrong person. She didn&rsquo;t do anything to you. All she did was reject your advancing on her because she already has a boyfriend, and you know that. You should be getting back at Rick, not her.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I can&rsquo;t get back at either of them now.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />You&rsquo;re cooking something.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />What?</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />You&rsquo;re planning to do something. What you did today was premeditated. You came into school with the intent of causing havoc and you acted like everything was normal, don&rsquo;t lie to me, I could feel you! And I have the same feeling now. You&rsquo;re going to do something bad and you&rsquo;ll get us all in trouble.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I&rsquo;m not planning to do anything I swear. I was in a bad mood when I came into school and I acted cheerful when I wasn&rsquo;t but I honestly never thought of making myself and Gina fail on purpose. It&rsquo;s just...</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />Tell me, tell me why you did it. I&rsquo;ll die if you don&rsquo;t tell me.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />RIP, Milena.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />Tell me!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I honestly don&rsquo;t know! When I walked to the front of the class and Ms. Roberts asked me for the papers, I felt like a fool for forgetting to take my papers out before I got up from my seat. And I thought, man it would be so miserable if I actually forgot to bring my papers after all this hard work, Gina will definitely kill me. And then the image of Gina, sad and disappointed and hurt, popped into my mind, and I couldn&rsquo;t take it out of there. And then, it&rsquo;s like I actually believed I forgot the papers, and when Ms. Roberts asked me the question, I knew that I knew the answer, but I couldn&rsquo;t pull it out of my memory.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span> (cont&rsquo;d)<br />It&rsquo;s like I lost control of myself. I couldn&rsquo;t act or speak, I could only watch. For a moment there I was a stranger in my own body.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />A stranger in his own body. Works as a title for a novel. Were you a stranger in your own body when you told Ms. Calvert to shut her hole?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />No, that was just me. I always wanted to do that.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />Alright, there&rsquo;s one more thing that&rsquo;s burning my mind to know...</p>

<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />No promises.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />You can&rsquo;t be late to my fucking birthday party!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Alright, relax! I&rsquo;ll be here early.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />Ok, see ya. Hey, I forgot. What&rsquo;s the gift?</p>

<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />I can&rsquo;t wait to see it. I won&rsquo;t sleep all night, you know me.</p>

It was 4 PM. He was supposed to meet Jenny at 5, but time was slippery. He didn&rsquo;t have her number, so he headed straight to her house. Jenny lived near where Ned and he did, and he&rsquo;d seen her and her mother walk to church on Sundays.</p>

<p><span class="Chanel">CHANEL</span><br />She&rsquo;s busy right now. Are you Michael?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Yes, that&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p><span class="Chanel">CHANEL</span><br />Why did you tell her to wear something fancy if you&rsquo;re gonna go out with her like that?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I&rsquo;m not here to pick her up yet. I just wanna tell her something first.</p>
<p><span class="Chanel">CHANEL</span><br />Let me make one thing clear to you, son. I don&rsquo;t like you or your family. The fact that you never attend church only adds to my disapproval. I cannot permit my daughter to be romantically involved with someone who does not share our strong Christian faith.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />There is nothing romantic between me and Jenny, ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll tell you that if you ask her. I&rsquo;m going with her to the cinema only because she&rsquo;s the only one who wants to see that movie as bad as I do. We&rsquo;re just friends. I told her to wear something fancy as a joke. Trust me, Jenny and I are never meant to be with each other.</p>
<p><span class="Chanel">CHANEL</span><br />Fine by me. I&rsquo;ll let her go because she does want to go with you. But you have to be very careful of her. She has a very sensitive condition.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />With all due respect, Mrs. Preston. I don&rsquo;t care about your beliefs or Jenny&rsquo;s conditions. She seems pretty normal to me.</p>
<p><span class="Chanel">CHANEL</span><br />What did you just say?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I&rsquo;m sorry, Mrs. Preston. I didn&rsquo;t mean to be rude to you. I just had a very bad day and I can&rsquo;t wait for your daughter to make it up to me.</p>

<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span> (firmly)<br />Can I speak to Jenny now?</p>

<p>She didn&rsquo;t answer, just slammed the door in his face. He stood there, listening to her call for Jenny, the sound of her stomping down the stairs echoing through the wood.</p>

<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />Are you ok?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />You look funny with makeup on.</p>
<p>Her cheeks were rosey, now flaming red. She glanced back at the door, checking if anyone was watching. No one there, but Michael felt the hairs on his neck stand up. Someone was lurking behind that half-closed door. He quickly restored the his notgiveadamn mindset.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />I saw Gina and Kelsi and Rick bully you.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I couldn&rsquo;t do anything to them. They&rsquo;ll kick me out of school if I fought with them. Wait till I get off the surveillance program. I&rsquo;ll make them all kiss your feet.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />No! Why do you and Kelsi want people to kiss my feet?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Just wait and I&rsquo;ll show you what I&rsquo;ll do to them.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />Please don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s better to forget and forgive.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Sorry, Jenny. You know I&rsquo;m not religious.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />I saw Kelsi punch you really hard. Are you ok?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Yeah, I&rsquo;m used to it. It&rsquo;s part of our training. If any other man took that punch, their guts would spill to the floor.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d expected her to cringe at that but surprisingly she didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I&rsquo;m not here to pick you up yet. My little sister and I will need more time to steal the money. Do you wanna come with us?</p>

`
${storyImage('6')}
<p>Lexi was the widow who lived in the second biggest house in the neighborhood. She was a mean old bat, hated kids like a cat hates water. Kenzie and he used to sneak into neighbors&rsquo; houses for kicks, pulling pranks and scavenging treasures. Lexi was their favorite customer. She was known to be particularly harsh, always screaming at the kids in the street. Her screams were legendary. Besides, it was very easy to get her blood boiling, by simply existing under the age of 14.</p>
${storyImage('7')}
<p>Kenzie and Michael have always scared of her and they had many reasons to believe even the grownups in the neighborhood were. You&rsquo;d usually hear people excuse her because of her grief over her husband&rsquo;s passing, but the kids knew for sure everybody hated her guts. Now, it was scary enough to just walk by her house, dread was to be inside it, so we they were extra careful the few times they sneaked into it, extremely anxious to be caught, and that made the whole adventure more rewarding than any other. The thrill of getting under skin of the scariest woman of their childhood was always worth every damn risk.</p>
${storyImage('8')}
<p>They didn&rsquo;t steal every time they sneaked into a house, even when they had the opportunity to do so, but sometimes they did. Lexi was rich, whether from her dead husband or her own cunning, they never figured out. They had lost interest in her when Michael turned 14.</p>
${storyImage('9')}
<p>But they knew her habits...</p>
${storyImageCenter('10')}
<p>They had discovered that Lexi had this habit of stashing unnecessarily large amounts of money in her clothes. Didn&rsquo;t matter where. Pockets, folds, linings&mdash;if it could hold cash, Lexi would shove a fortune inside.</p>
${storyImageLeft('11_1')}
<p>Kenzie and he had endless mocked and criticized the habits of rich people.</p>
<p>Many times did they roleplay the scenario where Lexi is sitting in a restaurant and she bends over to scratch an itch in her foot, only for the waiter to suddenly show up and ask her to pay the bill. Luckily, she finds a roll of $500 under the fold of the strap of her sock so she hands it to the waiter without having to get up and she continues scratching her foot.</p>
<p>Or the time she was paying the cashier at the pharmacy and stopped to calculate the shortest distance between her hand and any of her coat&rsquo;s many many pockets, before she finally gave the cashier the money, told him to keep the change, and left him a $100 tip on top of it. When the cashier argued that they don&rsquo;t accept tips at the pharmacy, she requested to speak to the manager and gave him a lecture on how poor individuals should be given the right to take a tip no matter how useless their jobs were.</p>
<p>And many many silly childish over-the-top situations like that, told by the imagination of two children who knew very little about the adult world.</p>
<p>Michael and Kenzie found a clothes hanger upstairs, draped with tops. A fur coat caught their eye, with its inside pocket bulging.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Stop fooling around, Kenzie, we should get out of here quickly.</p>
<p><span class="Kenzie">KENZIE</span><br />I&rsquo;m gonna take this one home.</p>
<p>They knew Lexi wouldn&rsquo;t bother report it to th police, and she was too antisocial to even ask the neighbors about it.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />It&rsquo;s not even your size.</p>
<p><span class="Kenzie">KENZIE</span><br />It&rsquo;s gonna be in two years.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />No, it&rsquo;s not. We&rsquo;ve lost all hope of you growing any taller.</p>
${storyImage('12')}
<p><span class="Lexi">LEXI</span><br /><span style="font-size:5rem">5:47!!!</span></p>
${storyImage('13')}
<p>Hearing the angry cuckoo of Lexi waking from her nap at an uneven minute, they bolted. Kenzie snatched the money from the coat&rsquo;s pocket and they fled.</p>
${storyImage('6')}
<p>Once safe, they counted their haul. My lady and my gentleman, can you guess how much money Lexi had in that one random pocket on that one random coat she had hung around?</p>
<p>A mere $2500.</p>
<p>That was their greatest scavenge ever, by a long fucking mile. Kenzie tried to hustle Michael out of a fair share, given how little he did throughout job, but he stood firm. They split the money evenly and walked home, their pockets heavier.</p>

<p>He took a shower, let the water scald him clean, then called for Sherrie to help him dress for his &ldquo;date.&rdquo; He knew how to dress for a date, but this was different. This was his first date since he&rsquo;d embraced dominance. He asked Sherrie what to wear. She rummaged through his wardrobe, her face serious, and pulled out this...</p>
${storyImageCenter('14')}
<p>A black shirt, black pants, and black leather boots. He chuckled at the idea. Black on black on black. Bland and boring. He argued he&rsquo;d never go out like this. It was something only a grown man would wear.</p>
${storyImageRecurringRight('sherrie_room')}
<p><span class="Sherrie">SHERRIE</span><br />You don&rsquo;t wanna give her the impression you&rsquo;re a boy.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I get it but we&rsquo;re both teens. It feels a little over the top.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">SHERRIE</span><br />Why?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Black leather shoes? That&rsquo;s too formal and old-fashioned.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">SHERRIE</span><br />There are things that never go old fashioned. I&rsquo;m not really aware of what the cool kids wear these days but I know a real man wouldn&rsquo;t wear anything in this wardrobe on a date except for these three items. And black suits you very well, master.</p>
<p>He was sure Sherrie was out of touch with modern dating and fashion. Her idea of dating had to be from over 20 years ago. She hadn&rsquo;t dated since Adrian. He couldn&rsquo;t picture himself in public dressed like this, feeling it was pretentious and uncool. Why take advice from a woman who constantly boasted she wasn&rsquo;t like most women? Still, the fact that she acknowledged her old-fashioned views and had clear reasoning behind her choice reassured him.</p>
<p>More importantly...</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Do you think Adrian would&rsquo;ve dressed like this on a date in highschool?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">SHERRIE</span><br />Adrian looked best in black.</p>
<p>That was all he needed. Adrian&rsquo;s old-school tricks might not fly today, but they were certainly hot. This was a playdate anyway.</p>
${storyImageCenter('15')}
<p>As he started to put on the pants and the black shirt, he reconsidered. Maybe a shirt with white buttons, breaking the monotony with a white t-shirt underneath, open and casual.</p>
${storyImageRecurringRight('sherrie_room')}
<p>Sherrie, stubborn as a mule, insisted on the black shirt with black buttons and nothing underneath. His idea wasn&rsquo;t bad, but he needed to show Jenny he was serious. Even if she thought he was being fake, she&rsquo;d understand he was playing a strong character. She&rsquo;d let him wear what he wanted later, but for the first date, he had to trust Sherrie.</p>
<p>Michael didn&rsquo;t like her implying she had the authority to allow or stop him from doing anything, but he let it slide. He&rsquo;d have to punish her for that later.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I don&rsquo;t wanna overdress. What if she goes out wearing jeans and a tshirt. We&rsquo;ll look ridiculous.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">SHERRIE</span><br />Aren&rsquo;t you capable of handling this situation?</p>
<p>Sherrie spoke sharply. And he noticed she&rsquo;s calling him master less often. Next time she slipped, he&rsquo;d put her in her place. Michael didn&rsquo;t mention it, but Sherrie saw the seriousness in his eyes.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">SHERRIE</span><br />Apologies, master. May I ask you what kind of girl she is?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I don&rsquo;t know how submissive she is, to be honest.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">SHERRIE</span><br />I was talking about her other personality traits master. Is she shy? Is she bold? Is she fun and lively and talkative?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />She&rsquo;s shy. Shyer than shy. She barely looks anyone in the eye except for me and that only started recently. I don&rsquo;t seem to ever be in her vicinity without her vibrating from anxiousness. She comes from a very strict religious family too. Both her mom and dad are pastors.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">SHERRIE</span><br />Ooh.</p>
<p>Sherrie&rsquo;s eyes lit up as he described Jenny. They warmed, grew fond. Whatever image she had of Jenny in her mind must have been beautiful. Michael didn&rsquo;t exaggerate a detail about Jenny, but he emphasized that she was shy, hoping it would support his point in wearing something less audacious. He didn&rsquo;t know what exactly attracted Sherrie to Jenny so much. Sherrie, who was sitting on the bed, immediately jumped to her feet, grabbed the shirt and T-shirt he wanted to wear, threw them inside his wardrobe, and closed it shut.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">SHERRIE</span><br />Master, you have to win this girl no matter what.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />It&rsquo;s not even a real date. I don&rsquo;t even like the girl. She&rsquo;s just a friend and I&rsquo;m just testing the dominant style on her because I can&rsquo;t seem to ever go wrong with her. This is just a game.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">SHERRIE</span><br />Oh, trust me, master, you have to win her. She&rsquo;s the perfect girl for you and you&rsquo;re the kind of man that can please her best. You might never find a girl like her again.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Sherrie, I already love someone else.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">SHERRIE</span><br />Trust me, master. You&rsquo;ll regret this for the rest of my life.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Sherrie, we&rsquo;re not understanding each other here.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">SHERRIE</span><br />Please, master, do it for me.</p>
<p>For the second time today, a woman put her hand on her heart and pleaded with him to listen. Maybe Sherrie saw herself in Jenny or maybe she fantasized about seeing him corrupt a pure girl. He didn&rsquo;t feel anything for Jenny. He hoped he broke Gina&rsquo;s heart. He was glad to break Sherrie&rsquo;s too.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />You think she&rsquo;ll really wear something fancy?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">SHERRIE</span><br />I&rsquo;m sure she will. I&rsquo;ll bet my life on it.</p>
<p>So he caved, dressed in the black ensemble Sherrie picked. Black on black on black, with a silver watch, a black-bottled perfume, and Mom&rsquo;s car keys. He didn&rsquo;t ask if Sherrie had permission to take any of these things; she&rsquo;d been with them long enough to handle it. He let her spray him with the perfume, pocketed the keys, and wore the watch on his left wrist.</p>
<p>He looked in the mirror and saw a very cool dad.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">SHERRIE</span><br />You look perfect, master.</p>
<p>The whole thing felt like a bad idea, a lame joke. He wasn&rsquo;t confident, but the reflection in the mirror was exciting. He saw someone new. 
Sherrie tried to give him advice on what to do with Jenny, but he brushed her off. He was going out to have fun, not follow a script. If he used any of 
Adrian&rsquo;s moves, he&rsquo;d stick to what he knew. This wasn&rsquo;t the time for lessons. Sherrie wouldn&rsquo;t stop, whispering advice in his ear 
until he finally rushed out of the room and ${appendLinkRowInline('down the stairs', '5e', true)}.</p>

<p>Kenzie&rsquo;s jaw dropped when she saw him. He put his face in his palm. Expected her to laugh but she didn&rsquo;t. She looked annoyed, lips pursed, hands on hips, rocking them slightly, eying him up and down. Mandy was shocked too. She sniffed his pants and shirt like a dog.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I know, right? I&rsquo;ve embraced the dark side. This is not my goth phase. This is my Tobey Maguire Spiderman 3 phase. Kenzie didn&rsquo;t laugh. Mandy chuckled. He blew Mandy a kiss, turned, and walked out.</p>

<p>Preston told him to wait in the living room while she called Jenny. 2 minutes later. He heard their footsteps coming down the stairs.</p>
${storyImage('16')}
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Wow.</p>
<p>Jenny came into the room in a black, off-the-shoulder dress that clung to her body, revealing just enough of her chest to make her self-conscious. She kept adjusting it, though it was designed to slip off a shoulder. Michael was surprised Jenny even had a dress like that. Jenny came into the room without glasses. With her makeup style, lipstick, and sexy dress, Jenny came into the room without Jenny. Micahel was mesmerized.</p>
<p>Preston sat on the couch and watched Michael and Jenny stare at each other for a couple of seconds before she had the urge to throw a snarky comment at them.</p>
<p><span class="Chanel">CHANEL</span><br />You should&rsquo;ve told us you&rsquo;ll be wearing black. You don&rsquo;t look good both wearing a solid color.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />You look great!</p>
<p>Preston&rsquo;s comment didn&rsquo;t register. Michael ignored her. Jenny blushed at his compliment and turned away immediately, hiding her face.</p>
${storyImage('jenny_living')}
<p>When you complimented a girl and she turned around that was an invitation to devour her with your eyes. He knew Jenny turned out of shyness&mdash;still, his eyes took the opportunity to eat up every fold and curve on the other side of her body.</p>

<p>Preston didn&rsquo;t allow him to ignore her this time. Preston lunged at him, yanked him into the hall by his arm, telling Jenny to give them a moment.</p>
<p><span class="Chanel">CHANEL</span><br />Jenny, give me a moment with your friend for a second.</p>

<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Mrs. Preston, I swear to you, the heavens, and the Lord in it, that no man will hurt Jenny while I&rsquo;m with her, except for me. I cannot vouch that I will not hurt her myself.</p>
<p><span class="Chanel">CHANEL</span><br />She has a condition!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Her condition is falling in love with me. And I feel like, by the end of this night, I might have a condition too.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t know how to react to that.</p>
<p><span class="Chanel">CHANEL</span><br />Return her by 10.</p>
<p>Teasing Jenny was one thing, but teasing this woman was a whole different story. You can&rsquo;t tease them too much though.</p>

<p>They arrived at the cinema at 7:40 PM. He bought two tickets for the 8:00 PM screening, each a cool $100. Few minutes to the screening, the place was half-empty, seats begging for butts. He wanted seats in the back row but Jenny wanted the same seats as last time. A silent nod to their last time there, to something good. He booked them, no questions asked.</p>
${storyImage('concession')}
<p>They hit the concession stand, a chaotic mess of people and overpriced junk.</p>
<h3>INT. LOBBY - EVENING</h3>
${storyImageRight('jenny_cinema_1')}
<p>Jenny, shy and anxious in her tight, black dress, wanted to skip it. He insisted on popcorn. &ldquo;Worth it,&rdquo; he said. She wasn&rsquo;t thrilled but agreed, asking if she could wait inside.</p>
<p>Jenny was uncomfortable with people staring at her and Michael. They looked ridiculous, being a teenage couple who over-dressed in all-black for a movie night out, so they caught the eye. While She rarely looked people in the eye directly, Jenny knew when she was the center of someone&rsquo;s attention. Michael hated that she wanted him to do all the work while she sat comfortably in the theater. Didn&rsquo;t like that she was so nervous of others while she was with him. It was selfish and disrespectful. However, this was far from being a situation he couldn&rsquo;t handle.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Why the hell would I allow you to stay away from me?</p>
<p>He grabbed her hand, dragging her into line. Line was quite slow to move but luckily, five minutes in, another worker opened a new line. He nudged Jenny, and they jumped to the front, first in line.</p>
${storyImage('concession_worker1')}
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />A large bucket, please.</p>
${storyImage('jenny_cinema')}
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />Shouldn&rsquo;t we get two?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />No, we have to eat from the same bucket like last time. If we need more we can buy another bucket in the break.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />But- but- our hands...</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />That&rsquo;s half the fun of it.</p>
${storyImage('concession_worker1')}
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />One humongous bucket, please.</p>
${storyImageLeft('concession_worker2_1')}
<p>The worker filled a large bucket, enjoying the sight of the oddball couple, eyes darting to their clasped hands, a grin stretching across her face.</p>
<p>They got a soda with the popcorn for free, part of a special that night. The worker chuckled when Michael asked her if she was kind enough to give them two straws; at the implication they would otherwise share have to share the single straw, Jenny squeezed his hand, hiding behind him. The worker&rsquo;s grin vanished, replaced with warm, fond eyes. She gave them another straw, on the house.</p>
<p>When he was ready to pay, Michael rubbed the back of Jenny&rsquo;s hand gently, in circles with his thumb, signalling she should let go. 
Jenny didn&rsquo;t wanna, wouldn&rsquo;t stop squeezing. To take money out of his wallet with one hand awkwardly was a skill honed over years of practice for less ridiculous reasons than this. 
He had no trouble paying the bill, but when it came to taking their loot off the counter, he required Jenny&rsquo;s cooperation.</p>

<p>They caught the movie on time. Sank into their seats and watched the movie from end to end this time.</p>
<p>The movie was great. In retrospect, he thinks he might&rsquo;ve enjoyed it alone. This is, without a doubt, the best movie of all time, he marked. But somehow Jenny being there added a layer to it. They were both much more focused on the screen this time, barely talking, no popcorn games, didn&rsquo;t need to use the second straw.</p>
<p>Michael teased her subtly. When he saw her too conscious of the dress falling off her shoulder, he put his arm around her, covering her exposed shoulder, kept it there. He unconsciously pulled her close during intense moments of the movie. Jenny&rsquo;s reaction to his touch seemed less and less pronounced after a while.</p>
<p><br />He touched Jenny a lot throughout their date. She was quite slow to act on her own and he would constantly pull her hand or her waist or even her hip to guide her on where to go. That was the case when they went out for another bucket during the break.</p>
<p>Not once did Michael touch her that night with an impure intent, other than teasing her and making her uncomfortable, although he started to enjoy comforting her when she was too anxious or too happy. While Jenny looked stunning tonight, she was only so by comparison to her usual self, she was still miles away from the women in his fantasies. She couldn&rsquo;t evoke a single sexual feeling in Michael. Yet this was<br />one of the most memorable nights of his life.</p>
${storyImage('cinema')}
<p>After the credits rolled, they walked out, still buzzing about the film.</p>
${storyImage('jenny_house_late')}
<p>He dropped Jenny home, walking her to her doorstep. They couldn&rsquo;t stop talking about the movie. After lingering for 5 minutes in front of her house, Michael had to cut the conversation short. He thanked her for the night, forgetting to kiss her hand. And then, out of the blue, Jenny said this.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />W-Would you like to come inside?</p>
<p>They were acting Adrian and Sherrie but both forgot their lines. By the way this night went, we&rsquo;ll say they forgot to play Michael and Jenny as well. Michael found himself nodding in agreement.</p>
<p>Jenny excused, went inside the house to tell her mom she came back home. When the coast was clear, she returned and she and Michael snuck their way 
${appendLinkInline('upstairs', 'section7')} to her room.</p>

<p>Inside, Jenny&rsquo;s room was a mess. Jenny flopped on her bed. Michael found no chair, so he sat on the floor.</p>
<p>They sat in silence for a couple of seconds, searching for ways to kickstart the conversation again. Jenny caught him stealing a look between her thighs, so she immediately pulled her dress down and jumped to her feet. She excused herself to the bathroom to change to something more comfortable and take her contacts off.</p>
${storyImage('jenny_room1')}
<p>Jenny came back very quickly. She changed her clothes but still kept the contact lenses unlike she had said. Michael didn&rsquo;t comment on her choice of home clothing or ask about her glasses. She lay on the bed again, on her stomach, watched Michael from up there.</p>
<p>Both armed with a couple of minutes of preparation, they got the convo going pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Jenny, a true nerd, could only keep a conversation going if it revolved around her favorite hobbies. Michael, for some reason, kept dragging the talk as long as he could. It was&rsquo;t just &ldquo;his hormones playing with him&rdquo; like Sherrie said. If it was that he was horny, he would&rsquo;ve gone home and fucked Sherrie, or made her suck him till his urges were gone. He listened to Jenny&rsquo;s improvised essay on his favorite movie, not interrupting her once.</p>
<p>A week ago, he wasn&rsquo;t even sure if Jenny could even talk coherently. And then he was watching her give a 50-minute long monologue where she didn&rsquo;t stutter or falter a single time. Not only was he impressed, he was very entertained as well. Her attention to detail and the details of details was immaculate. Her ability to recall lines from the movie word by word, hell, even reciting them while making an accurate impression of the actors, was uncanny. He felt embarrassed having called himself a movie enthusiast before. He felt like a poser. This was real shit.</p>
${storyImage('jenny_room2')}
<p>In the heat of her passion for Whiplash 2, Jenny rolled herself out of her bed to the floor and lay down on her stomach next to Michael. Her monologue was full of interesting ideas and observations and so condensed with thoughts, that he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel few of those impressions were born tonight, and that Jenny had collected them over a long period of time and finally took the opportunity to share her favorite thoughts with someone. Michael couldn&rsquo;t have been happier to receive them.</p>

<p>Having presented all her ideas, Jenny rested her chin on her forearm, awaiting Michael&rsquo;s input. He didn&rsquo;t have anything half as interesting as what she said, nor 1/50th of it, and for the first ever he was the one lost for words around Jenny. He found himself resorting to her cheap tactic, looked away at the distance and remained silent.</p>
<p>Strangely, it felt comfortable. Being silent around Jenny. It was a quality of hers that bothered him before, tonight it attracted him to her. He lay down beside her, staring at the ceiling.</p>
<p>Jenny rolled on the floor a couple of times, trying to find the coziest position, until she lay supine like him. They remained silent for a while.</p>
<p>Then, she turned on her stomach, crawling close to his face. He turned to his side, their faces inches apart. She stared at him dreamily, examining his face, her lips drawing his gaze. and started examining the fine details of his face.</p>
${storyImageRight('jenny_room3_1')}<p><br /><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />I&rsquo;ve been dreaming...</p>
<p>... of a man in shining armor, with long golden hair and hands delicate like a porcupine&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been waiting for that man to come to my window on his white flying horse, and snatch me out of this miserable existence.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been having nightmares...</p>
<p>...of a man in a black suit, with short dark hair, a darker face, and coal-black hands with long slender fingers that are rough to the touch, who&rsquo;s standing guardian of my door,<br />keeping me imprisoned in this miserable room and ugly body.</p>
${storyImageRight('jenny_room3_1')}
<p>I hate this short fat body, I hate my ugly face and my stuttering tongue, I hate my sick flickering eyes and my shivering hands. I want the white man to save my beautiful mind, but he never comes. The horses are loose, got grass-sick.</p>
<p>How did we end up like this? How could I be hanging with you and how could you ever be sleeping in my room? I&rsquo;m dreaming.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been scared of you. I didn&rsquo;t want to be friends with anyone because I didn&rsquo;t want to burden anyone with my ugly stature. I kept my eyes exclusive to my only friend who was burdened to carry my fat body. The floor. You always bullied me and hurt me just to make me look<br />in your eyes<br />but I was so scared of you. I cried and I screamed and you got in trouble because of me, but still, you wouldn&rsquo;t go away.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />I hated you. I was lost in my dreams of being truly as beautiful as I am, and the sight of your feet reminds me of how small mine are. I wanted you to disappear but you&rsquo;re always there.</p>
<p>And that night, under the weak light of the silver screen, I thought my knight had finally run past the troops, and the guard, and that he would finally save me. And then I realized it was you, but still, I couldn&rsquo;t take my eyes off of you. I asked myself: Are you the glowing man or the man in black? And I thought: Why would my knight want to hurt me?</p>
<p>You jokingly said: &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; to hurt me.<br />And though cast in plaster,<br />you made my heart beat faster.</p>
<p>Until I found out you were a blasphemous sinner, and while in your presence I was only scared of you, that moment I was very scared of you.<br />So I had to run away.</p>
<p>That night, I dreamt of you. My knight in shining armor finally came on his white winged horse and broke the forever closed window, and called me to ride on the back of his horse. And then my soul started leaving my body, in my true beautiful form I started flowing out,<br />and suddenly the black man showed up and killed the knight and trapped my soul back in my body, and for the first time ever, the black guardian had<br />a face, yours, and he cursed me to stay small and ugly for ever come.</p>
<p>And I screamed &ldquo;I swear by Christ in heavens!&rdquo;<br />and you, blasphemous, joked &ldquo;My love, I swear by the air I breathe...&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Sooner or later, I&rsquo;ll claim your eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then I woke up and you weren&rsquo;t there. I went to school and you were finally gone. And I thought: Has the black man finally disappeared?</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />And then my mind, heart, eyes, and hands were put to ease. For three nights, I slept without dreams.</p>
<p>And this morning, you came back. Stronger and more sinister than ever, the black man came back. And I saw you hurt Gina for your pleasure, just like you hurt me, only you weren&rsquo;t joking with her. And I saw your eyes roaming around the classroom trying to hurt everybody, and I felt something for you. I know a Christian girl isn&rsquo;t supposed to feel for a man like you, but I was amazed by you.</p>
<p>I watched you hurt Ms. Calvert with that line and she tried to hurt you by calling you and your sister names, but you can hate more than anyone can hate, and I know it&rsquo;s not supposed to feel like this but it made me feel so close to you.</p>
<p>And then they called your name and said you and your friends will be punished for your mistakes and I asked myself: Am I a friend of yours?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been alone for years and I&rsquo;ve been longing for someone to talk to other than my feet and the floor. And then you would run after me when they told you to stop running in the halls and you&rsquo;d tell me that I&rsquo;m your friend, that I&rsquo;m your date and I&rsquo;m your love. And I&rsquo;ve been wanting someone to want and I&rsquo;ve been wanting someone to love me for so long and I didn&rsquo;t know if you were joking or hurting or if you could see the Jenny inside like no one else could and still wanted her trapped just to please yourself.</p>
${storyImageRight('jenny_room3_1')}
<p>And then I saw Gina and Rick, and Kelsi too, circling around you. And I couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes, they were bullying you! And I thought that would end the black guard and the white knight will come back&mdash;and you looked like you gave up but then you looked away and saw your prey, and so you stood up and<br />told them to give you all they got, and I saw you were ready to fight the whole world just to take what you wanted, my eyes that you have desired for so long and...</p>
<p>...I know it&rsquo;s not what it&rsquo;s supposed to do,<br />but in my own way, I fell in love with you.</p>
<p>Lord in the sky forgive me,<br />for I am knees deep in love with a sinning man.<br />Michael, I love you. I love you more than anything and I love you more than anyone could love and I want you more than anyone can want. I want you to love me.</p>
<p>I want you to see me as more than just a friend. Those two nights I was your friend, you made me feel more than all the movies and books I&rsquo;ve read in this miserable room and all the fantasies I&rsquo;ve had in my mind. I want to make you feel like you make me feel, and I want to be your love.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you my eyes, my soul, my everything. I&rsquo;ll shiver at your sight, I&rsquo;ll shake in your presence, I&rsquo;ll recoil in terror at hearing your voice. I&rsquo;ll learn to handle the pain. Only if you&rsquo;d love me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about the white knight anymore and I don&rsquo;t care about the world. They all can&rsquo;t defeat you. I want you.</p>
<p>Would you love me, Michael?</p>
<p>Would you want me, Michael?</p>
<p>Would you fuck me, Michael?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Jenny, you slut!</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />D-Did I blurt that out?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Hell yeah, you did! You screamed it at the top of your lungs!</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />Nonononono this is not happening. I&rsquo;m dreaming I&rsquo;m dreaming I&rsquo;m dreaming.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Jenny panicked. She slapped her face, rolling on the floor. He was scared.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Hey, hey, relax.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />Ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod.</p>
<p>He was scared, afraid she&rsquo;d hurt herself or wake her parents. He grabbed her hands, cuffed them, pinning her down, clutching her small hip with his massive leg, and trapping her head close to his chest with his forearm, trying to calm her.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Jenny, relax, I was kidding.</p>
<p>She shook her head repeatedly, refused to look up in his face.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />He can read my mind! He can read my mind!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />No, I can&rsquo;t read your mind. Listen to me! Listen!</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />No, they can read my mind through the vibration of my eyes. They can all read my mind.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />No no no no nobody&rsquo;s here but me. I didn&rsquo;t hear your thoughts, I swear.</p>
<p>Jenny began to calm down and opened her eyes.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />D-d-d-did you hear me?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />No, I didn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m only teasing you, remember?</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />Do you swear?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I swear I can&rsquo;t hear your thoughts.</p>
<p>Slowly, she relaxed, eyes opening. He let go, moving off her.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I&rsquo;m curious though, what were you thinking about?</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />N-nothing.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I have to know what was on your mind. It must&rsquo;ve been something serious. When I told you I heard you, you looked so flabbergasted.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />Flabber-gabber-blabber?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Yes, flabbergabber- ahahaha, look at you, dummy!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Come here, tell me.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />No, no, I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of anything.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Liar! You have to tell the truth. It must&rsquo;ve been something dangerous, I&rsquo;ll bet my life on it.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />Nothing!</p>
<p>Jenny buried her face in the floor, embarrassed. That was never gonna stop Michael from teasing her.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Were you going to kidnap me? Is that why you brought me here?</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />(muffled) No no no.</p>
<p>He straddled her back, knees right next to her small hips, fingers dancing near her sides and lower back, teasing a tickling.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Were you going to kill me? Are you going to kill your beloved Michael, Jenny?</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />Nooooo.</p>
<p>Then, he tickled her viciously. Jenny screamed, muffled by her hand covering her mouth, then the screams turned to laughs. Micahel tickled her violently and she squirmed, trying to escape, but he held her hips firm.</p>
<p>He finally eased up, stopping the tickle torture. Gave her a minute to catch her breath while still straddling her, both were panting, then his body dropped, he lay on top of her, crushing her back with the weight of his chest, and whispered menacingly in her ear...</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Do you know what I want to do to you right now?</p>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s response, so simple and soft, caught him off guard...</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />Ah!</p>
<p>The softest, faintest moan he&rsquo;d ever heard was still capable of rocking him out of this mood. He immediately realized how inappropriate the position they were in was, and jumped to his feet. He glanced around in disbelief. He was in Jenny&rsquo;s room, she&rsquo;s lying on the ground between his feet, his heart is racing, he&rsquo;s sweating, he&rsquo;s confused, and worst of all, his cock is growing hard.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Jenny, I have to leave now.</p>

<p>Jenny got up, fixing her clothes, friction with Michael and the floor had messed them up. She stared at Michael for a couple of seconds, lips</p>
<p>trembling like she wanted to say something but couldn&rsquo;t. She dashed to the door, checking if the coast was clear. Then she came back, and they sneaked down her stairs to the front door. He wished her a good night; she nodded twice, awkwardly.</p>
<p>Michael walked to Mom&rsquo;s car, parked stupidly right in front of Jenny&rsquo;s house all this time. He hoped Jenny&rsquo;s parents didn&rsquo;t notice it. Got in the car and drove home.</p>

<p>Just as he stepped into the house, Sherrie pounced, eager for her master.</p>
${storyImageRecurringRight('sherrie_hall')}
<p><span class="Sherrie">SHERRIE</span><br />Master, how did the date go?</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t care to stop to talk to her. Simply walked past her.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Sherrie, you just lost a bet on your life.</p>
<p>He went upstairs to his room.</p>
