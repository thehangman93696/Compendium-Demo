<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Birdie">BIRDIE</span><br/>Daddy, I'm scawwed.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Joshua">JOSHUA</span><br>Scared of what, honey?</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Birdie">BIRDIE</span><br>Teddy says monsta in da bathtub.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Joshua">JOSHUA</span><br>Fuck that teddy bear.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Birdie">BIRDIE</span><br>Daaaaaad. He can ear you.</p>
<p>Birdie cupped the bear's ears.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Joshua">JOSHUA</span><br>There are no monsters in this house, honey. Don't be afraid.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Birdie">BIRDIE</span><br>Daddy, I want piss.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Joshua">JOSHUA</span><br>Go into the bathroom, then.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Birdie">BIRDIE</span><br>Please come.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Joshua">JOSHUA</span><br>No. You're old enough to go in by yourself.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Birdie">BIRDIE</span><br>Please, daddy, please.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Joshua">JOSHUA</span><br>Baby, don't beg me, I'm not going into the bathroom with you.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Birdie">BIRDIE</span><br>Please, dad, one time. Just one. Look.</p>
<p>She lifted her skirt and showed me a wet spot on her panties, right in the middle of her camel toe.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Birdie">BIRDIE</span><br>I'm leaking.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Joshua">JOSHUA</span><br>Ugh. Fine.</p>
<p>I took her hand, led her to the bathroom. She clutched my hand with both of hers, started hopping with each step I took. I walked, she hopped, the teddy bear's arms flapped under her armpit like dead wings, and then she stopped. I pulled her but she didn't budge.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Birdie">BIRDIE</span><br>Mm-mm.&nbsp;So scared.</p>
<p>Why the fuck did she ask me to come with her then?</p>
<p>I slipped my hands under Birdie's armpits and scooped her up. She wrapped her legs around my waist and clung to my neck.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Joshua">JOSHUA</span><br>Come on. Daddy will beat all the monsters for you.</p>
<p>She cheered up and began humping my chest happily. I carried her into the bathroom and set her down in front of the toilet.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Joshua">JOSHUA</span><br>See? No monsters. I'll wait outside the door, call me when you need me, ok?</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Birdie">BIRDIE</span><br>No. Stay with me.</p>
<p>She pulled her panties down and sat on the toilet, her butt hitting the toilet seat with a soft thud. I stood in front of her but my eyes were directed at my way out of here.</p>

<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Birdie">BIRDIE</span><br>Dad, it's not coming.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Joshua">JOSHUA</span><br>What?</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Birdie">BIRDIE</span><br>Water can't piss.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Joshua">JOSHUA</span><br>Why? What's wrong?</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Birdie">BIRDIE</span><br>I'm pushing no pee pee.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Joshua">JOSHUA</span><br>Maybe you're shy because I'm here. I-</p>
<p>She grabbed my hand.</p>

<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Birdie">BIRDIE</span><br>No, please stay. We need you.</p>
<p>She said it so innocently like she was truly scared. I felt bad for her.</p>
<p>I sat down on my knees under the toilet, lifted her skirt and glanced at her crimson red pussy, then I put the skirt down to look at my baby's grumpy face. She's trying too hard but it's not coming.</p>
<p>I slid my hands under her skirt and started rubbing and massaging her thighs. She looked a little bit more relaxed. I stroked her tiny thighs going up to her crotch, then I caressed between her thighs and crotch with my thumb. Her face is getting more and more relaxed.</p>
<p>I began massaging her crotch, making circles with my fingers above and below her pussy and all around it, being extremely careful not to touch the red slit. I did all of that, but still, no water be pissing.</p>

<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Joshua">JOSHUA</span><br>Come on, honey. Keep trying.</p>
<p>I nodded at her and she nodded back. She's struggling.</p>
<p>My honey is in pain right now.</p>
<p>I lifted babygirl's skirt and put my head underneath it. Then I began blowing cold air on her pussy. I felt my girl's thighs tense up a little bit. I took my head out from under her skirt.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Joshua">JOSHUA</span><br>Baby, hold your skirt up for me.</p>
<p>She did just that. I spread her legs wide and lowered my head to her crotch again, scanning her pussy closely.</p>
<p>And then with the tippity tip of my finger, I brushed her pussy lips ever so gently. No water came still. I carefully spread her pussylips with two fingers and blew cold air at them.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Joshua">JOSHUA</span><br>Come on, baby, you can do it.</p>
<p>I kissed her smooth crotch softly. Her face looked more comfortable, so I gave her another peck, and she closed her eyes.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Joshua">JOSHUA</span><br>Come on, baby, do it for Daddy.</p>
<p>I kissed the babyskin above her pussy a third time, this time for longer. I kept sucking her crotch with my lips and she shrieked awkwardly in response.</p>
<p>Until, finally, she gave out a long sigh, and then I heard her piss hitting the toilet water. She peed a good lot. I gave her a couple of pecks on her crotch once she started pissing, calling her a good girl. I wanted to keep rewarding her while she pissed, so I went down and smooched her marble of a crotch until she finished pissing."</p>
<p>She finally finished pissing. Big relief on her face. She looked so happy and full of gratitude that I was there for her.</p>
<p>I felt quite happy and proud.</p>
<p>I looked for toilet paper but unfortunately, we were out of it. I looked for anything to wipe her pussy with and the first thing I saw was the teddy bear in her hand. I snatched the teddy from her and reached to wipe her pussy with it.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Birdie">BIRDIE</span><br>No! Not Teddy.</p>
<p>I digressed. I wiped my honey&rsquo;s pussy with my hand and then washed it, then I helped her get up from the toilet.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Joshua">JOSHUA</span><br>Are you happy now?</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Birdie">BIRDIE</span><br>I'm very happy.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Joshua">JOSHUA</span><br>Don't you want to do it from behind too?</p>
<p>She paused for a couple of seconds to think about it.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Birdie">BIRDIE</span><br>No, it's not there.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Joshua">JOSHUA</span><br>Are you sure? I don't want you to wake me up in the middle of the night to take you to the bathroom again.</p>
<p>She looked uncertain. I turned her around by the waist, helped her bend over and lifted her skirt up. Her panties were still on the floor,<br>she hadn't worn them back yet. I spread her little butt cheeks and started tickling her pink asshole very lightly.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Joshua">JOSHUA</span><br>Any kaka coming out?</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Birdie">BIRDIE</span><br>Mm-mm. No, Daddy. Not now.</p>
<p>I helped her stand up straight and pinched her little cheeks.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Joshua">JOSHUA</span><br>See? Nothing to be scared of. Daddy's always here for you.</p>
<p>She hugged me and kissed my cheek about 10 times in a row. Then she stepped back and looked at me very gratefully.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Birdie">BIRDIE</span><br>Thank you so much, Daddy.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Joshua">JOSHUA</span><br>Daddy's always here for you, honey.</p>
<p>She shook the bear in the air in front of me.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="DIS-Birdie">BIRDIE</span><br>Teddy says thanks fo' killin' 'em all muddafuckin' monstaz!</p>
<p>Fuck that teddy bear.</p>
