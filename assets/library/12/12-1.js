<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="GN-Dad">Dad:</span> &ldquo;Contest! Staring contest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad and I had a staring contest. He won.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="GN-Dad">Dad:</span> &ldquo;Booya!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mom rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>I played a contest card as well.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="GN-Tom">Me:</span> &ldquo;Mom, I challenge you to an arm wrestling match.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="GN-Mom">Mom:</span> &ldquo;Ugh, that&rsquo;s too easy. Don&rsquo;t be boring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I digressed. I challenged Dad instead, and I won the match easily.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="GN-Mom">Mom:</span> &ldquo;Give me another booya, honey.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="GN-Dad">Dad:</span> &ldquo;He has an advantage because of his big hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="GN-Mom">Mom:</span> &ldquo;Well, you know what that means.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="GN-Dad">Dad:</span> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a stupid myth, babe. It was debunked in the 90&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="GN-Mom">Mom:</span> &ldquo;Oh yeah? Put your money where your mouth is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mom played a &ldquo;who-has&rdquo; card.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="GN-Mom">Mom:</span> &ldquo;I want to see which of you has a bigger cock. Hmph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sat there staring at their faces, trying to find out if they were joking or something. Dad sighed, stood up, and removed his belt. They told me there was no refusing requests or challenges, and I knew they took their stupid game seriously, but I didn&rsquo;t know they took it this far. I got up, and both Dad and I dropped our pants in front of Mom, who didn&rsquo;t even bother looking at Dad&rsquo;s cock.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="GN-Mom">Mom:</span> &ldquo;Told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad looked down in shame. We wore our pants again and continued the game. He avoided eye contact with me for the next 3 three rounds.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="GN-Mom">Mom:</span> &ldquo;Request! Richard, I want you to get down on all fours and bark like a dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad played a say-no card. Mom had to change her target or else the request card would go to waste.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="GN-Mom">Mom:</span> &ldquo;Alright, Tom, get down on your knees.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="GN-Tom">Me:</span> &ldquo;Reversal!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="GN-Tom">Me:</span> &ldquo;Mom, I want you to... give me a lap dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="GN-Dad">Dad:</span> &ldquo;Pfft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad looked impressed that I learned the game so quickly. Mom&rsquo;s luck of the draw was exceptional and she had collected more points than Dad and I combined. Dad and I had a silent agreement to team up on her for either of us to have a chance, and suddenly we were turning the table on her. But Mom was a pro in this game.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="GN-Mom">Mom:</span> &ldquo;Oh yeah? Contest! Musical chairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The contest card, they said, could be used to interrupt any other action card. It could be used a wildcard against a request, only if the the proposed contest and the request were related somehow. Dad, who took the role of a ref in case of conflict, determined that musical chairs was indeed a fitting challenge to my demand for a lap dance.</p>
<p>The game began. Mom and I circled a lone chair we placed in the middle of the living room to some music. When Dad cut the music, we both rushed to the chair. I was just a hair quicker, and she ended up in my lap. Mom;s laugh cracked through the room and I couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh along with her.</p>
<p>And then I slid my hand up her leg, rubbed her inner thigh and tapped it gently.</p>
<p class="story-dialogue"><span class="GN-Tom">Me:</span> &ldquo;Come on, Mom, it&rsquo;s time for my lap dance.&rdquo;</p>
