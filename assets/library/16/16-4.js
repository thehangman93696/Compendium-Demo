<p>As the Maths class drew to a close, Roberts assigned the class a task.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />You will be given a task over the weekend. You will each be paired up with another student and given two papers with problems that must be solved and submitted by Monday. You will have to work to together on these problems, as both students in the pair will receive the same grade. Make sure to understand the questions and answers quite well, because I<br />will be asking about them on Monday. Do you have any questions?</p>
<p>Nobody in the room dared to raise a question. Roberts passed out the papers among the class. Michael&rsquo;s eyes scanned the document he received, but it might as well have been written in hieroglyphs for all the sense it made to him. He hoped Roberts would have the good sense to pair him with a nerd.</p>
<p>Roberts began assigning partners. Michael bided his time, watching and waiting for his turn.</p>
<p><em>Please, anyone but Kelsi or Ned,</em> Michael muttered under his breath, a silent plea. He&rsquo;d sooner take a dive off a cliff than spend one second partnered with either of them.</p>
<p>His bet was on Milena. Roberts knew they were thick as thieves, and Milena had a knack for crunching numbers. Michael couldn&rsquo;t find a reason she&rsquo;d pair him with anyone else.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />Michael, you will be with Gina.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t see that coming.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />Ms. Roberts, can I-</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />Gina, I will take no complaints. I won&rsquo;t allow changing pairs because if I do that, I won&rsquo;t see the end of it.</p>
<p><span class="Rick">RICK</span><br />Ms. Roberts, some of these pairs don&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p><span class="Kelsi">KELSI</span><br />Guys, chill! She said there will be no changes.</p>
<p>Rick and Gina shut up after Kelsi&rsquo;s shout.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />Kelsi, when I&rsquo;m inside the classroom, I would like all talk to be addressed to me.</p>
<p><span class="Kelsi">KELSI</span><br />Yes, ma&rsquo;am.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />You three and your pairs will be docked a point off your assignments. Do you have anything else to say before I go on?</p>
<p>All gazes converged on Kelsi, her glare igniting and fixated on Rick as if she was visualizing murdering him. Kelsi was indifferent to the grades but not to the stain on her reputation, bristled at the notion that no one would want to be paired with her as her mere presence in a pair dragger her potential partners down, thanks to the point deducted.</p>
<p>Michael found himself taken back by the severity of Roberts&rsquo; response. Kind and sweet as she was, everybody knew she doesn&rsquo;t tolerate impudence. Her punishment seemed a touch too severe though. Kelsi was trying to stand up for her. Michael didn&rsquo;t like the way Rick talked to Roberts either but he didn&rsquo;t have Kelsi&rsquo;s lightning-quick reflexes.</p>
<p>He was impressed by Roberts&rsquo; effective punishment. Her punishment seemed targeted directly at Kelsi, and we dare say no other punishment would have been as severe on her as this. Kelsi loathes injustice. Had Kelsi restrained her impulse, perhaps six students wouldn&rsquo;t have suffered the fallout of lost points in the assignment.</p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s her fault they&rsquo;re all being punished,</em> Michael thought. Gina and Rick lounged carefree, a smirk playing on Rick&rsquo;s lips. But Kelsi... Kelsi was hurt.</p>
<p>Roberts resumed her pairing, the tension in the room thick as fog. Michael watched, a bystander caught in the drama. He was punished for something he didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with, unlike the other three. The relief washed over each student spared from Kelsi&rsquo;s wrath, leaving Michael one of the few remaining scapegoats. With Kelsi&rsquo;s fury blazing, being paired with her seemed a fate worse than death.</p>
<p>Think Kelsi would apologize to whomever was paired with her? Not likely. She&rsquo;d sooner bash their head in with her fist. Whoever&rsquo;s stuck with her will wish they were anywhere else but here.</p>
<p>Fair or not, she wouldn&rsquo;t be on the losing end of any situation. Whoever ends up with Kelsi will be humiliated to the point where school grades didn&rsquo;t matter to them anymore.</p>
<p>Only one soul dared to yearn for Kelsi&rsquo;s company. Milena, head bowed in silent prayer, pleaded for the partnership she craved.</p>
<p>Roberts, ever the puppeteer, reveled in the tension she&rsquo;d sown. Not only did she enjoy watching high school drama, she decided to create some on her own.</p>
<p>With only four left unpaired, the stage was set for a final showdown: Kelsi, Rick, Milena, and Ned.</p>
<p>Ned&rsquo;s eyeing Milena, hoping for a match. Rick couldn&rsquo;t care less about the assignment, but he&rsquo;ll dodge Kelsi&rsquo;s team like the plague. And as for Kelsi... she&rsquo;s got her sights set on Rick, absolving herself of guilt of bringing someone&rsquo;s grade down, since Rick was marked the point already.</p>
<p>If Roberts wanted to do a service to this world, she&rsquo;d pair Milena with Kelsi and Ned with Rick. Milena could seize her chance, and Ned fails the assignment, Michael thought to himself.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">JEN</span><br />Milena you will be with Ned.</p>
<p>Kelsi smiled, Rick sighed, Ned waved at Milena, and poor Milena was heart-crushed.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, Michael lingered in the hallway, anticipating Milena&rsquo;s emergence from the classroom.</p>
${storyCenterImageRecurring('rick_hall')}
<p>Rick and Gina came out of the class together, but they were soon approached by angry Kelsi. Kelsi reprimanded Rick for talking up to Roberts inside the class. This being a thing involving Kelsi, a small crowd gathered, watching the spectacle. Gina stepped back and stood awkwardly, not knowing what to do as she witnessed her boyfriend&rsquo;s chastisement by Kelsi.</p>
${storyImageLeft('1')}
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br>So, when are we gonna do this thing?</p>
<p>Gina jumped when Michael approached, but a flicker of a smile came across her lips at his sight. Must&rsquo;ve been a welcome distraction from the chaos. Quick to hide it though.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />What do you want?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />When are we gonna do the assignment?</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />I&rsquo;ll just make one of the nerds do it for me.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />You can&rsquo;t let anyone else do it for you. You and I get the same grade, remember? Besides, we&rsquo;ll be asked about this stuff on Monday, she&rsquo;ll know if you cheat.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />Fine, let&rsquo;s do it tomorrow after school. We can meet at the school library.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Nah, I&rsquo;m not free tomorrow.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />What about Sunday?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I&rsquo;m busy the whole weekend.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />Oh yeah? So when are we gonna do this stuff?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Tonight. We can meet at my house.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />No way! I&rsquo;m not gonna go to your house, weirdo.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Why not? You scared of a nerd like me?</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />You&rsquo;re not a nerd. Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know why Ms. Roberts assigned me to you. You&rsquo;re as bad in Maths as I am, probably even worse.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Yeah, you&rsquo;re right. I looked at this paper and I didn&rsquo;t understand a single word.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />Ahahaha. Same.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I know how to get the answers, though.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />How?</p>
<p>He edged closer to Gina, dropping his tone to a whisper.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />You know my dad is a scientist, right?</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />Is he gonna do your homework for you?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />No, he doesn&rsquo;t have the time for that. He created a program that can solve any problem and ask any question you have for it.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />No fucking way!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />It&rsquo;s true, I&rsquo;ll show you.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />That&rsquo;s not enough, dummy. We need to learn all this stuff to pass.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Gina, you have no idea how far the technology has advanced in this day and age.</p>
<p>Gina giggled, giving Michael&rsquo;s shoulder a playful jab.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Dad has a lot of crazy inventions like this. They&rsquo;re all over the house. Do you know we have a robot maid?</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span> (a playful tease in the eyes)<br />Oh yeah?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Yeah, I can&rsquo;t wait to show her to you.</p>
<p>Her smile disappeared in an instant. Michael must&rsquo;ve come on too strong.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />I can&rsquo;t go to your house. My boyfriend wouldn&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Bring him with you.</p>
<p>Gina twirled her hair, stealing a glance at Rick in the midst of his dispute with Kelsi before turning back to Michael.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />Why don&rsquo;t we meet at my house?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Where do you live?</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />What?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I&rsquo;m not gonna come if you live too far.</p>
<p>Surprise flickered across her features. No doubt, no one in the school had ever spoken to Gina like that. Even the toughest of guys got jittery around her. Her beauty was mesmerizing. People usually bent over backward just to bask in her presence for a minute. And here he was, telling her she wasn&rsquo;t worth the trouble. Michael couldn&rsquo;t care less. He had no business even talking to Gina, let alone in this tone. If she says no, he&rsquo;ll go home and fuck Sherrie.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />I live on 7th Street.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I&rsquo;ll be there at 7.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />Wait. That&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />See ya!</p>
${storyImageRecurring('school_hall')}
<p>Michael sauntered off. It felt so good to be in charge. A few steps later, it hit him like a ton of bricks&mdash;he forgot to ask her something important.</p>
${storyImageCenter('1')}
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I forgot to ask you something.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />You did.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Where exactly on 7th?</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />Aw, I would love to tell you, but you seem to be really busy. See you!</p>
${storyImageRecurring('school_hall')}
<p>She waved casually before striding away. Fuck. Looks like he&rsquo;ll be knocking on every door down 7th then.</p>

<p><span class="Ned">NED</span><br />She lives at house 713.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />What are you... (slaps the back of Ned&rsquo;s head powerfully... fucking eavesdropping on us?!!</p>
<p>Ned whimpered and cowered, hand covering his ringing ear. Milena stood up for him.</p>
${storyImageRecurring('milena_ned_hall')}
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />No, he was standing with me while you were talking to Gina. We were both listening to you.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span>(turning to Ned)<br />How do you know where she lives? Are you stalking her?</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />He&rsquo;s a nerd, Michael. He knows everything.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />He&rsquo;s not a nerd, he&rsquo;s a piece of shit.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />He was trying to help.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Just let him talk for himself for a second, will you? Why do you have to be such a square about everything? Wow, a square and a circle. You two fit each other perfectly.</p>
<p><span class="Ned">NED</span><br />What kind of logic is that?</p>
<p>Milena and Michael burst into laughter. It was their thing, throwing out random lines like that. Seeing Ned so offended by that was hilarious. After a good laugh, Michael turned around and walked towards the school door. Milena quickly followed, and Ned waddled ${appendLinkRowInline('behind them', '1d')}.</p>

<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />How are you gonna study with her with that small brain of yours? I guess Gina will do all the work.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Fuck the assignment, I&rsquo;m taking her out.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />Take her out where?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I&rsquo;ll take her to the cinema. Remember the movie I told you about? Whiplash 2? It&rsquo;s coming out tonight. I bought tickets<br />a while ago and I can&rsquo;t wait to see it. I&rsquo;ll ask her out after we study and we&rsquo;ll go together.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />Dude, you&rsquo;re crazy. She has a boyfriend!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I&rsquo;m a better man than he is.</p>
<p>Milena was intimated by Michael&rsquo;s rising aggression.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">MILENA</span><br />Ummm...</p>
<p><span class="Ned">NED</span><br />Gina likes action movies.</p>

${storyImageRecurringRight('sherrie_hall')}
<p><span class="Sherrie">SHERRIE</span><br />Master!</p>
<p>Sherrie dashed towards him, eagerly meeting him at the door.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">SHERRIE</span><br />Master, I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you.</p>
<p>He was happy to see Sherrie. In fact, he had planned to call her the moment he walked in. When he promised Gina answers to the assignment, he had Sherrie in mind. She&rsquo;s a mathematician and she can probably crack the whole paper in 10 minutes. But when he saw her, he changed his mind.</p>
<p>He liked Sherrie better when she was submissive and obedient to him and he controlling over her. If he asked her to tutor him in math, they&rsquo;d have to switch roles for a bit. Plus, he&rsquo;d be laying bare his mental shortcomings right in front of her. Whatever impression Sherrie had of him at that moment, he aimed to maintain it.</p>

<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Kenzie!</p>
<p><span class="Kenzie">KENZIE</span><br />Yes, mast- umm, Michael?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Kenzie!</p>
<p><span class="Kenzie">KENZIE</span><br />Yes, mast- umm, Michael?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />What&rsquo;s wrong with you?</p>
<p><span class="Kenzie">KENZIE</span><br />Nothing. Did you want something from me?</p>
<p>This is Michael&rsquo;s little sister Kenzie. She&rsquo;s 2 years younger than him but leagues above him in intelligence. She&rsquo;s going through a goth phase right now, but trust us she&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Do you know anything about... what is it called?</p>
<p>He retrieved the assignment paper from his bag.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Indefinite integrals?</p>
<p><span class="Kenzie">KENZIE</span><br />Let me take a look.</p>
<p>Michael showed Kenzie the paper, and she skimmed it with her eyes in a flash. As she did, he filled her in on the assignment details.</p>
<p><span class="Kenzie">KENZIE</span><br />Easy. Give me 30 minutes and I&rsquo;ll write you the solutions.</p>
<p>30 minutes?!! He figured those questions would take hours to solve, and then some more to jot down the solutions.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I don&rsquo;t need the solutions. I need to know how to solve them. I&rsquo;m paired up with a girl at school and she has a paper with different questions. We&rsquo;re gonna meet tonight and solve them together.</p>
<p><span class="Kenzie">KENZIE</span><br />Oh, I see. So you want me to show you how to do it.</p>
${storyImageRight('4')}
<p><span class="Kenzie">KENZIE</span><br />Alright. Sit down.</p>
${storyImage('5')}
<p>Kenzie grabbed a book and a notebook, hopping onto her bed. He settled in next to her.</p>
${storyImage('6')}
<p>Kenzie dove into the problems right before Michael&rsquo;s eyes. He couldn&rsquo;t believe how quickly she cracked each one. No hesitation, just straight into the solutions. Her approach was a world apart from what they&rsquo;d learned in class. A little bit more sophisticated, but generally more intuitive and easier to implement once you memorize the steps.</p>
<p>As she penned down the solutions, she broke them down for me in simple terms that even he could understand, knowing just how to tailor her explanations for her big bro&rsquo;s not-so-big brain. Her examples were easy for him to visualize, making it all click like never before. Studying math never felt so easy in his life.</p>
<p>Once all the answers were neatly inked, she passed him the notebook, urging him to give it a shot himself. He took up the challenge, following her lead as best he could, albeit not as elegantly. Kenzie watched over his shoulder, guiding him through the rough patches, her casual banter filling the air as they worked through the problems together.</p>
<p><span class="Kenzie">KENZIE</span><br />So who&rsquo;s the lucky girl?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Someone in my class. You won&rsquo;t know her.</p>
<p><span class="Kenzie">KENZIE</span><br />Is she cute?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />She&rsquo;s the hottest girl in the whole school.</p>
<p><span class="Kenzie">KENZIE</span><br />Really? Beauty is subjective, you know.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />She&rsquo;s the most beautiful girl in school, in my eyes. You happy now?</p>
<p><span class="Kenzie">KENZIE</span><br />Are you dating?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Not yet. I&rsquo;m making my move on her tonight. I&rsquo;ll take her to the cinema.</p>
<p>Her silence hung heavy in the air. He lifted his gaze, catching her fiddling with the bedsheet.</p>
<p><span class="Kenzie">KENZIE</span><br />What are you gonna watch?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Whiplash 2!</p>
<p><span class="Kenzie">KENZIE</span><br />There&rsquo;s a second part?!!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Yeah, it&rsquo;s coming out tonight. I&rsquo;m gonna be one of the first people to see it. I booked two tickets for the premiere once they were available. It starts tonight at 11.</p>
<p><span class="Kenzie">KENZIE</span><br />Oh my god, that&rsquo;s so cool. I loved the first movie so much. I wanna see the sequel.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Tell your friends and go watch it together or something.</p>
<p><span class="Kenzie">KENZIE</span><br />Yeah, I guess I can do that. What if they&rsquo;re not interested? Would you take me to see it?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I&rsquo;m not gonna pay to watch it twice.</p>
<p><span class="Kenzie">KENZIE</span><br />Oh, so I do all of this for you and you don&rsquo;t wanna take me to watch a movie?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Uhh, I guess you&rsquo;re right. You know what? I&rsquo;ll make you a deal. If things go well tonight, I&rsquo;ll take you to the cinema on the weekend.</p>
<p><span class="Kenzie">KENZIE</span><br />Really?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I promise.</p>
<p><span class="Kenzie">KENZIE</span><br />So what do you mean by things going well.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Well, if we start dating because of the whole studying together thing, I&rsquo;ll have to do something to pay you back, right?</p>
<p><span class="Kenzie">KENZIE</span><br />Oh, thank you so much, big bro. You&rsquo;re the best.</p>
<p>Kenzie gave him a big hug.</p>
<p><span class="Kenzie">KENZIE</span><br />Do you have enough money for the date? I can go take some money from Dad if you want.</p>
<p>That was a weird thing to say, Michael mused silently. Guess she&rsquo;s bent on ensuring the date goes well now. Wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if she starts giving out dating advice any moment.</p>
<p>He told Kenzie he had enough cash, which was true&mdash;He still had the $1000 from Mom&rsquo;s birthday gift tucked away&mdash;but no need for her to know that. They swiftly returned to hitting the books.</p>
<p>Ninety minutes later, he had my own solutions neatly written down. It took them a total of three hours to crack the whole thing, from 3:30 to 6:30. With that wrapped up, Michael snagged Kenzie&rsquo;s book and notebook, bid her room farewell, and headed off to prep myself for the rendezvous with ${appendLinkInline('Gina', 'section3')}.</p>

<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />What makes you say that?</p>
<p>She was surprised by the shift in his tone. Gina was surely accustomed to exerting pressure on boys. She wasn&rsquo;t used to being teased.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />Well... all boys are jerks, naturally.</p>
<p>A little bit of pressure and she&rsquo;s being defensive.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I&rsquo;ll have you know that not all men are like that. Some are very nice and caring, genteel and comely even.</p>
<p>Gina chuckled.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I&rsquo;m not one of them though. I&rsquo;m the biggest jerk of them all!</p>

<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Because you&rsquo;re a big teaser.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span> (gasp)<br />What?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Anyway. Are we gonna start with this stuff or what?</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />What do you mean by big teaser?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Gina, we don&rsquo;t have much time. Are we gonna study tonight or not?</p>
${storyImageRight('11')}
<p>They began studying immediately. He examined her paper, noted her problems were similar to his own. Skimming it, he undertood Kenzie&rsquo;s techniques would work with all of them.</p>
<p>He proceeded to guide Gina through the solutions, explaining the robot&rsquo;s intuitive methods as Kenzie had taught him. Initially hesitant to use methods not taught in class, Gina eventually embraced the unconventional approach, when Michael convinced her to give it a chance and she saw how easy to implement they were.</p>
<p>Michael noticed Gina was brighter than she looked, quickly learning and understanding a problem once able to visualize it or when it was stripped to very simple terms, pretty much like Michael actually. Her glaring issue lay in her inability to stay interested doing one thing for a long span of time. She would frequently get lost in her tracks and start fiddling with her hair, play with the pages of her notebooks, or stare into Michael&rsquo;s eyes meaninglessly. He had to nudge her shoulder each time she was distracted to wake her up to what she was doing.</p>
<p>She seemed to like it a lot when he complimented her intelligence, which he did repeatedly throughout the night to push her.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Wow, you&rsquo;re way smarter than you look.</p>
${storyImageCenter('12')}
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />What do you mean by that?</p>
<p>She gave him a playful look, relishing the opportunity to tease him in return.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I bet you&rsquo;re hiding your brains to stay popular at school.</p>
${storyImageRight('10')}
<p>Gina shook her head slightly, not understanding what he meant.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />If people knew you&rsquo;re so smart, you&rsquo;ll lose your status as the hottest girl in school.</p>
<p>That seemed to trigger her. She suddenly became animated, all excited.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />What does that have to do with that?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />You&rsquo;re either hot or you&rsquo;re smart, you can&rsquo;t be both.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />Who made that rule? Why can&rsquo;t a beautiful girl live like a smart one?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />It just doesn&rsquo;t work like that.</p>
<p>The mood took a somber turn all of a sudden. Gina fell silent, her gaze dropping to the notebook unprompted for the first time since their study session began. A hint of sadness flickered in her eyes.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Do you have plans for college?</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll make it to college.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Why not?</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />Not destined for me, I guess.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Hey, I was just joking when I said that.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />I don&rsquo;t know. I would love to go to college. I just can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Why not?</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />Life and shit.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Wow, you have a story too. So full of surprises.</p>
<p>She playfully punched his shoulder. Didn&rsquo;t complain that girls should have life and stories too.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />If you got a scholarship, would you go to college?</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />Only the top students in this school get a scholarship.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span> (locking eyes with her, resting his hand on her thigh)<br />And that&rsquo;s gonna be you and I, Gina.</p>
<p>Once Michael&rsquo;s hand landed on Gina&rsquo;s thigh, a light electric shock went through his hand, which Gina felt too. They pulled apart simultaneously, their bodies jerking backward at the same time. Wide-eyed and surprised, they stared at each other for a couple of seconds.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />What&rsquo;s the time?</p>
<p>Checked his watch. 10:35.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Shit! I&rsquo;m late. Gina, I gotta go.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />But we still haven&rsquo;t finished yet.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />It&rsquo;s only 2 problems left. I&rsquo;m sure you can do them on your own.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />Ok, if you really have to go, I&rsquo;ll show you to the door.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now or never, Michael.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Do you wanna come with me?</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />Where?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />To the cinema?</p>

<p>Gina kicked him out of her house.</p>
<p>What did he expect? For her to linger outside her house past midnight with a guy she just started talking to? Yeah, she&rsquo;s supposed to be cool, but he must&rsquo;ve looked shaky when he asked her out. Damn. He had momentum, felt like a big deal until he blew it. But on second thought, it went better than he had expected. They definitley had chemistry. Maybe he still has a shot. Just needs to play his cards right from now on.</p>

<p>As soon as Micahel descended the steps of Gina&rsquo;s porch, Rick materialized before him.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Hey, what&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p>Rick offered no response, instead immediately attacked Michael, ensnaring him in a headlock.</p>
<p><span class="Rick">RICK</span><br />I asked first. What are you doing here? Are you stalking my girl?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />What? No, I was studying with her.</p>
<p><span class="Rick">RICK</span><br />Studying? You? Pfft.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />What&rsquo;s your problem, man? Let me go!</p>
<p><span class="Rick">RICK</span><br />Stop crying, man. I&rsquo;m only playing with you.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Let me fucking go!</p>
<p><span class="Rick">RICK</span><br />What are you gonna do about it?</p>
<p>Michael growled as Rick&rsquo;s headlock tightened around him.</p>
<p><span class="Rick">RICK</span><br />Not so tough when your sister&rsquo;s not around, huh?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />What do you want?</p>
<p><span class="Rick">RICK</span><br />I wanna know what you&rsquo;re doing in front of my girl&rsquo;s door this late at night.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />We were studying!</p>
<p><span class="Rick">RICK</span><br />Oh yeah? I don&rsquo;t believe you.</p>
<p>Rick dragged him to Gina&rsquo;s doorstep and rang the doorbell. Michael struggled and fought with all his might, but couldn&rsquo;t break free from Rick&rsquo;s<br />grip; the man was too strong. Michael dreaded the thought of Gina seeing him like this. He couldn&rsquo;t let her see him ${appendLinkRowInline('like', '4c')}...</p>

<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />Rick leave him alone!</p>
<p>Gina was surprised to see Michael in this predicament. The surprise quickly morphed into disappointment. She will never look at him the same way<br />again.</p>
<p><span class="Rick">RICK</span><br />Hey, baby. What&rsquo;s this guy doing here?</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />He&rsquo;s my partner in the assignment!</p>
<p><span class="Rick">RICK</span><br />Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s right. I forgot.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />Let him go.</p>
<p><span class="Rick">RICK</span><br />Don&rsquo;t worry, babe, he&rsquo;s enjoying this. Don&rsquo;t you like being held like that, Michael?</p>
<p>He lost the power to speak.</p>
<p><span class="Rick">RICK</span><br />How are you doing, bae?</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />Same, same. Do you wanna come in?</p>
<p><span class="Rick">RICK</span><br />Hell yeah, I do. Let me finish with this guy first.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />Be careful he&rsquo;s a tough guy.</p>
<p><span class="Rick">RICK</span><br />Why did Ms. Roberts pair you with this jerk?</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />She&rsquo;s punishing him.</p>
<p><span class="Rick">RICK</span><br />What?</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />Because I&rsquo;m a big tease.</p>
<p><span class="Rick">RICK</span><br />What are you talking about?</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />That&rsquo;s what the boss said.</p>
<p>She shifted her gaze towards Michael, eyes filled with disdain, with a hint of pity.</p>
<p><span class="Rick">RICK</span><br />Oh, I see. He told you that?</p>
<p>Rick delivered a blow to Michael&rsquo;s gut, causing him to double over in pain before collapsing to the ground, clutching his stomach. Then, as he lay<br />there defenseless, Rick landed a kick to his chest.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />You know what? Give him another kick for asking me out.</p>
<p><span class="Rick">RICK</span><br />He what now?</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />He wanted to take me to the cinema.</p>
<p><span class="Rick">RICK</span><br />What the fuck?</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />I&rsquo;m telling you. This guy is not what he seems. He&rsquo;s dangerous.</p>
${storyImageRight('13')}
<p>Rick delivered two more kicks to Michael&rsquo;s stomach, leaving him sprawled on the ground, trying to make sense of the situation.</p>
<p><span class="Rick">RICK</span><br />You wanna take her on a date, punk? Look at you. All dressed up and shit. You actually thought you were gonna take her out?!!!</p>
<p>Michael cringed and whimpered but Rick didn&rsquo;t land another kick. Rick reached into Michael&rsquo;s back pocket and deftly removed his wallet.</p>
<p><span class="Rick">RICK</span><br />You must&rsquo;ve taken big money from your rich daddy to take my girl on a date, huh?</p>
<p>Michael could only watch as Rick extracted the ten $100 bills from his wallet and meticulously counted them.</p>
<p><span class="Rick">RICK</span><br />Are you fucking kidding me?</p>
<p>Michael had no place in his heart for jokes right now.</p>
<p><span class="Rick">RICK</span><br />10 dollars? That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re gonna take her out with? So fucking pathetic.</p>
<p>Stunned and immobilized by the pain of Rick&rsquo;s assault and the fear of further harm, michael lay motionless on the floor, his mind seething with rage. Wide-eyed, he gazed in astonishment as he observed the ten 1-dollar bills clutched in Rick&rsquo;s hand, illuminated by the dim light of Gina&rsquo;s porch.</p>
<p>Michael was confused. What the hell is going on now? Why does Gina have this sarcastic look on her face and why is Rick looking at him in disgust? Why is he lying down on the floor? This seemed quite unfair to him. What did he do for this? He helped Gina do the homework and gave her a good time. He&rsquo;s sure she enjoyed it. She did. So why was he now in agony at her doorstep? He knows why he doesn&rsquo;t have his grand, his jealous little sister stole it replaced it with 10 bux so he wouldn&rsquo;t notice his wallet was empty.</p>
<p>Why is Rick taking his valuable movie tickets out of his wallet now?</p>
<p><span class="Rick">RICK</span><br />Do you wanna go to the cinema, Gina?</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />What movie is that?</p>
<p><span class="Rick">RICK</span><br />It&rsquo;s called Whiplash 2.</p>
<p><span class="Gina">GINA</span><br />Never heard of it.</p>
<p><span class="Rick">RICK</span><br />Pfft. What kind of human garbage are you, man?</p>
<p>Rick raised his leg, ready to strike again. Michael flinched, but Rick only snickered. With a cruel smirk, he tore the tickets in half and hurled them, along with Michael&rsquo;s wallet, at his face.</p>
${storyImage('8')}
Then, without a backward glance, Rick and Gina walked into her house, slamming the door shut in Michael&rsquo;s ${appendLinkRowInline('face', '4e')}.

<p><>He rose, brushing off his clothes, and checked his watch. 10:50. The movie started in 10 minutes. Grabbing the torn tickets and his wallet and started running. He ran and he ran and he kept running. He ran in the streets, towards the city center, between the people and the cars. He ran because he was angry, he was sickly disappointed in himself.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t want to think about what had just happened. He wanted to kick that feeling of anger and disgust out of him. He ran because he really wanted to watch that movie, he&rsquo;s been waiting for it for a long time now. Nothing will make him miss it.

<p>At 11:10, he arrived at the theater, standing before it as he fumbled through his pockets. Fortunately, he found a crumpled 50-dollar bill that he had overlooked putting in his pocket. Entering the theater, he approached the clerk and presented the torn tickets. The clerk, visibly surprised by their condition-torn to pieces they were-examined them closely. Michael had anticipated this reaction, prepared to offer a bribe if necessary. He wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to part with the $50 bill if it meant gaining entry to the movie. He was that desperate.</p>
${storyImage('16')}
<p><span class="ticker-taker1">TICKET TAKER</span><br />These tickets won&rsquo;t work. I can&rsquo;t let you in.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Look, man, you&rsquo;re not gonna stop me from watching this movie. I&rsquo;ve been waiting for it to come out for over a year now. I bought these tickets the moment they went on sale, and tonight my date left me and her boyfriend beat me up and tore my tickets. Can you put yourself in my place?</p>
<p><span class="ticker-taker1">TICKET TAKER</span><br />Jesus! This sucks for you, doesn&rsquo;t it? I wish I could say I&rsquo;ve been there and done that, kid, but that&rsquo;s a new low.</p>
<p>A broad smile illuminated Michael&rsquo;s face. A simple comment from a random guy like that meant a lot to him.It cheered him up. Suddenly, he saw how funny his whole situation was from afar.</p>
<p><span class="ticker-taker1">TICKET TAKER</span><br />Go in, son. Have a good time.</p>
<p>Michael was grateful for the guy but didn&rsquo;t come to him to thank him. Without a moment to spare, he hurried into the theater.</p>
${storyImage('17')}
<p>Michael entered the auditorium playing the film at 11:13. The screening had started already but it was only ads yet. He couldn&rsquo;t shake the awkwardness of walking into the theater alone. It felt dismal to watch a movie solo in the cinema. Glancing around, he noted that while the auditorium was busy, it wasn&rsquo;t full. It&rsquo;s a shame that such a great movie doesn&rsquo;t get a fully booked premiere in the biggest cinema in the city...</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he wasn&rsquo;t surprised. Whiplash 2 is an independent films and these films weren&rsquo;t popular in their city. Most people in the city would only pay to watch a blockbuster.</p>
<p>Among his acquaintances, he was the only enthusiast for the movie; Milena, Gina, and Kenzie couldn&rsquo;t care less about it. Observing the other moviegoers, he noticed they all had company, chatting and laughing as they enjoyed their outing. He stood out as the lone individual entering alone, which made him feel weird and out of place.</p>
<p>He suddenly spotted a girl seated alone on the second row, her attention fixed on the screen, eagerly awaiting the movie&rsquo;s start. Turns out he wasn&rsquo;t the only miserable soul there that night.</p>
${storyImageCenter('18')}
<p><em>Wait. Is that ${appendLinkInline('Jenny', 'section5')}?!</em> His mind screamed at her sight.</p>

<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Hey, is this seat taken?</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />Michael!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />What are you doing here?</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />I- I-</p>
<p><strong>&mdash;Sit down asshole!</strong></p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Sorry to interrupt you while you&rsquo;re stuttering, can I sit down next to you?</p>
<p>Jenny nodded her head repeatedly.</p>
<p>Michael sat beside her. Her eyes flicked back to the screen as the movie began. Grabbed a handful of popcorn from her big bucket and stuffed it in her mouth.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Is somebody here with you?</p>
<p>Jenny shook her head.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Really? Guess what? I&rsquo;m here on my own too. Well, I had a date of course, but something turned up so she couldn&rsquo;t make it. I don&rsquo;t like watching movies alone so I&rsquo;ll just sit with you.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />That&rsquo;s ok.</p>
<p>He was surprised she didn&rsquo;t mind. Even more surprising was how comfortable she was keeping eye contact with him.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Can I have some popcorn?</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />Yeah, of course. Take it all.</p>
<p>Jenny handed Michael the bucket. He reached in and found it half-empty. Did we mention it was a big bucket? It was massive! Michael never knew they came that big even. That thing was big enough for a whole family!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Wow. You ate all that alone? the movie only started 15 minutes ago.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />I love popcorn a lot.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />You must&rsquo;ve been really hungry.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />No, it&rsquo;s just... Good movies make popcorn so much better and this movie is so good, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Wow. You like it a lot, don&rsquo;t you? Look how excited you are!</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t answer him. Her face blushed as she tried her best to keep her eyes on the screen. They watched in silence for a few minutes. The bucket sat in Michael&rsquo;s lap as he ate the remaining popcorn alone. Jenny was absorbed in the movie, but Michael saw Jenny&rsquo;s head turn to him to snatch a glance at him and the bucket. Poor hungry girl wanted to eat so bad but she was too shy to slip her hand in the bucket with his inside. Jenny stayed silent. Michael usually liked silence, but for some reason, he felt the urge to run his mouth.</p>
<p><br /><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />You want some popcorn?</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />No, it&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;ve had too much already.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />But you said you loved it.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />I- I- I...</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Oh, don&rsquo;t act like you don&rsquo;t want it. Open your mouth.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />What are you doing?!!</p>
<p>He grabbed a handful of popcorn and tried to feed Jenny. She didn&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Well, you obviously still want to eat popcorn but you&rsquo;re too shy to put your hand in the bucket. You have to eat it with me.<br />I don&rsquo;t like eating alone!</p>
<p>She stared at him, bewildered. They tried to be quiet, but their noise bothered others. Jenny was uncomfortable with this, but she couldn&rsquo;t handle<br />Michael&rsquo;s pressure.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />Ok, ok, I&rsquo;ll.. eat with you.</p>
<p>They resumed watching the movie. They ate the popcorn together, but Jenny waited until his hand was out of the bucket to reach for it. She didn&rsquo;t want their hands to touch.</p>
<p>Jenny looked uncomfortable and self-conscious with Michael sitting next to her. She fidgeted and sweated. Michael didn&rsquo;t know why she was so nervous. All he did was sit next to her and watch the movie. He was casual and nice.</p>
<p>He appreciated silence during movies, generally, but Jenny made it awkward. He started talking to ease the tension.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />You know who was coming with me tonight?</p>
<p>Jenny ignored him</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I was going out with Gina.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Man, she would be mad if she saw me with you right now.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />W-W-Why would she be mad?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />She&rsquo;d think I&rsquo;m cheating on her.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />What?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />She&rsquo;d think I went on a date with you instead.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />We&rsquo;re not on a date! We&rsquo;re not on a date!</p>
<p><strong>&mdash;Hey, what&rsquo;s going on here?</strong></p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span> (calling out)<br />Hey, take it easy on yourself, buddy!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span> (whispering)<br />Jenny, relax, you&rsquo;ll get me in a fight.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span> (whispering)<br />No, no, don&rsquo;t fight! We&rsquo;re not on a date.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I know. Of course not. I&rsquo;m way out of your league, dummy. But that&rsquo;s what people would think if they saw us together. I mean.. look at us.</p>
<p>He pointed at her, himself, then the bucket. Jenny blushed harder, lowered her head, and sank it between her legs. Maybe this wasn&rsquo;t the best way to ease the tension between them. In fact, it did the opposite. Something about Jenny made it fun to tease her. He couldn&rsquo;t stop himself.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Jenny, you can&rsquo;t tell anybody. This has to be our secret.</p>
<p>Jenny lifted her head.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />Secret? I can&rsquo;t... I&rsquo;m bad at keeping secrets.</p>
<p>He had trouble believing it. Did she even have any friends? He wondered.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />You have to promise me not to tell anybody.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />I- I promise.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Good girl. Eat some popcorn.</p>
<p>She chuckled. Wow. It was the first time he&rsquo;d seen her smile.</p>
<p>Then they watched the movie in silence for a while.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Jenny, can I ask you a question?</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />Sure.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Why are you here alone?</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />I wanted to watch the movie.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Yeah, but nobody&rsquo;s with you. Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s weird to watch a movie alone?</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />Well, I never watch movies with anybody. They would distract me from it.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />But that&rsquo;s like half the fun of it. I didn&rsquo;t even know they allowed you into the cinema on your own.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />I do that all the time, to be honest.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Well, kudos to you, I guess. That takes a bit of bravery I tell you.</p>
<p>He got no response. Jenny barely knew how to keep a conversation going. She would stop talking, look at the screen, and ignore him. It was very annoying.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I wish I could do that. Do you know how many movies I missed because I had nobody to go with? I mean.. how could you go to a movie alone? Aren&rsquo;t you afraid people will look at you weird?</p>
<p>She turned and looked at him.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />I don&rsquo;t care. I adore this movie. Whiplash is my favorite movie of all time. My greatest regret is that I didn&rsquo;t get to watch it in the theater when it came out. For some reason, a movie feels to me 10 times better&nbsp;here, even when I&rsquo;m alone, no, especially when I&rsquo;m alone. I love Whiplash so so much, it&rsquo;s like a religious experience to me. When they announced a<br />second part, I was swept off my feet. I kept counting the days till its release, today. This is very special to me. I love this movie more than anything. I love it way more than all these people here, combined. Nothing in the world could stop me from missing this.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Wow. This isn&rsquo;t like you at all. Haha, imagine this. Clumsy Jenny fighting the whole world to get what she wants. Well, I&rsquo;d pay to see that movie, for sure!</p>
<p>He saw the pink on Jenny's cheeks again.</p>
<p>Michael liked seeing her flattered by a simple compliment. She was excited about the movie, so he decided not to distract her any longer and he shut up and watch. Surprisingly, Jenny pushed to keep the conversation going.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />Michael, can I ask you a question?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Not if it&rsquo;s about Mathematics. You know I suck at it.</p>
<p>Jenny laughed despite herself. She covered her mouth to silence it.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />No, umm, why are you sitting here with me? It&rsquo;s not like you to be nice to me.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Well, I just told you I don&rsquo;t like watching movies alone, dummy. Learn to read between the lines.</p>
<p>She looked embarrassed. He felt bad for being too harsh. Her passionate monologue touched him. She was lively and honest. He was bummed and depressed after what had happened with Gina and Rick. He tried to hide it, not from Jenny, but from himself. He was acting, pretending. Jenny was genuine, not hiding or showing anything, and something about that felt nice.</p>
<p><br /><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve never come to the theater alone. I felt extremely weird walking in here, watching everybody laugh with a friend or partner, I was here on my own like a miserable piece of shit. I felt like I sucked the fun in the air by just being here. I haven&rsquo;t felt so self-conscious in a long time. When I saw you here, it kind of cheered me up, you know? Even though you&rsquo;re not the most fun person to be around, I don&rsquo;t feel so weird and out of place anymore just because I&rsquo;m sitting next to you.</p>
<p>Jenny didn&rsquo;t respond. She focused on the film. Michael turned back to the screen, but wanted payback at her. She left him hanging, made him uncomfortable. He&rsquo;d return the favor. When she reached into the bucket, he followed. Grabbed her hand like it was a handful of popcorn.</p>
<p>Jenny squeaked and shrugged. She tried to pull her hand out but Michael held it strongly.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />Umm... Michael?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Don&rsquo;t talk, Jenny, I&rsquo;m super focused on the movie.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />My hand...</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Oh, sorry.</p>
<p>Michael slowly let go of Jenny&rsquo;s hand. She pulled it out and resumed watching. He hoped she learned her lesson. He held the bucket but kept his hand out. Jenny hesitated, afraid he&rsquo;d do it again.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t stop smiling when she tried again. He watched the screen, but felt her eyes on him and the bucket. She quickly stole some popcorn. Seeing his smile, she shyly dropped her head and ate.</p>
<p>He resumed eating with her. He let her take a few handfuls, then he&rsquo;d brush or pinch her hand, making her jump. Their game didn&rsquo;t last long. They soon ran out of popcorn.</p>
<p>The mid-movie break came soon afterwards.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Hey, I&rsquo;m gonna go to the restroom. Do you want anything from outside?</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />No, thanks.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />We&rsquo;re out of popcorn. Don&rsquo;t you want more? I know I do.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />Uhhh... Yeah, me too.</p>
<p>Jenny withdrew some cash from her purse.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span> (trying to give Michael the money)<br />Buy one for me, please.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />What, are you crazy? I can&rsquo;t let you pay for it.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />Why not?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Otherwise, it won&rsquo;t be a date.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />But- but- but-</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Alright, alright, relax. I don&rsquo;t mind sharing, but you paid for the last one, let me pay for this one. How much was that bucket?</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />60 dollars.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />60 what?!!!</p>
<p>Why the hell was it so expensive? Was there a shortage on corn in the country or something?</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />Do- do you mind if I share in paying it?</p>
<p>Does he have a choice? He only had 50 dollars left. He made myself look really bad.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Jenny, I&rsquo;ll be honest, I don&rsquo;t have enough money.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />I can pay for it.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />That doesn&rsquo;t work either. I&rsquo;m the man in this relationship.</p>
<p>Jenny blushed deeply. Michael is growing used to the constant blushing and he can&rsquo;t get enough of it.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll get us the popcorn, and you don&rsquo;t have to pay for it.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />How?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Come with me.</p>
<p>His hand seized hers, yanking her up, guiding her behind him. They strode out, hand in hand, until they reached the ${appendLinkRowInline('lobby', '5b', true)}&rsquo;s concession stand.</p>

<p>The concession stand wasn&rsquo;t as busy as Michael had expected. He saw a family of five buying two big buckets of popcorn joyously departing the stand. A man, a woman, a teenager, and two young kids. They stood and chatted by a table. He tugged Jenny along, approached them. Once by their side, he pushed Jenny into them.</p>
<p>His shove propelled Jenny righward, clliding with the dad and the teenage girl, then tumbling to her knees. The family&rsquo;s focus shifted. The parents, both bent down to tend to Jenny, who immediately stuttered out an apology.</p>
<p>After pushing Jenny, Michael kept walking as if he hadn&rsquo;t noticed her fall. Sensing the family&rsquo;s attention on Jenny, he deftly grabbed a bucket from the unwatched table. He returned check on Jenny, enlisting one of the kids to carry the bucket, freeing his hands to aid Jenny to her feet. He explained Jenny had a balance problem and thanked them for their understanding and for being nice to them. He promised not to take his eye off Jenny all night so this wouldn&rsquo;t happen to her again.</p>
<p>The parents were touched by his concern over Jenny. They assured Michael and Jenny nobody was hurt and wished them a pleasant evening. The child gave Michael his Popcorn bucket back. Departing, he whisked the bewildered Jenny away.</p>
${storyImageRight('20')}
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />Michael, what happened? Why did you push me?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span> (pointing at the popcorn bucket)<br />Desperate times call for desperate measures.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />Where did you get that from? Did you...?</p>
<p>Jenny spun around, her eyes darting to the family now frantically searching for their missing second bucket.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span> (gasp)<br />Did you steal it?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />I took it from the table without them noticing. Thanks to my partner in crime of course.</p>
<p>Michael lifted my hand for a fistbump. Jenny left him hanging.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />You can&rsquo;t do that. Let&rsquo;s go give it back to them.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Look, I know they looked very nice, but it&rsquo;s not the end for them. Look, they&rsquo;re buying a new one already.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />That&rsquo;s so wrong! We could&rsquo;ve just bought a new one.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Yeah, but where&rsquo;s the fun in that? Look, I&rsquo;ll admit it was risky. But don&rsquo;t worry nobody saw us.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t completely sure. The family didn&rsquo;t notice, and no one else was close enough to see. Anyone who might have seen from a distance would probably question their own eyes and keep quiet to avoid looking like a fool.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />No, it&rsquo;s still wrong. Exodus 20:15, Thou shalt not steal!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Relax, Jenny, I know you&rsquo;re having fun. Trust me, there&rsquo;s nothing to worry about.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">JENNY</span><br />B-b-but...</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span> (chuckles)<br />I can&rsquo;t believe you and I are standing together in a cinema at the middle of the night just to watch a movie that no one we know cares about. Everybody we know is probably sleeping in their beds right now to wake up early for school, and we&rsquo;re here stealing popcorn from strangers. I don&rsquo;t know how we both ended up here, but right now, at this moment, it feels like you and I are the coolest boy and girl in the whole world.</p>
<p>Her face blushed, hard&mdash;harder as she searched his eyes. Her always-twitching eyes moved&nbsp;now more rapidly than ever. Yet her lips didn&rsquo;t move at all.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Look, the movie is about to start. Shall we go inside?</p>
<p>Jenny nodded repeatedly.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">MICHAEL</span><br />Good. Take the bucket and wait for me inside. I&rsquo;ll go to the restroom and join you in a second. Ok?</p>
<p>She nodded shyly once more.</p>
${storyImage('21')}
<p>Michael hit the restroom and unleashed the big piss he&rsquo;d been holding.</p>
${storyImage('22')}
<p>He left the restroom, strolling back to the auditorium. The movie was already playing again when he got there. He went to their seats in the second row, but Jenny wasn&rsquo;t there. Probably in the bathroom or something. He sat down and watched the movie. Ten minutes went by, no Jenny. Where the hell did she go? He decided to hit the ${appendLinkRowInline('lobby again', '5c', true)} and look for her.</p>

const row5c = storyRow('5c', 'INT. EMPTY LOBBY<br>NIGHT', 
`
${storyImage('23')}
<p>Michael wandered into the empty lobby, looking around. What was he trying to do? Walk into the women&rsquo;s restroom and check the stalls for Jenny? No, but her sudden disappearance made him anxious. No phone number, no way to call her. He just stood in front of the auditorium door, waiting.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t worried about her, not exactly. It wasn&rsquo;t about missing the popcorn either. He was worried she&rsquo;d...</p>
<p>Yes, ladies and gentlemen. Jenny left him in the middle of their accidental date. Roleplay or not, it stings to be dumped twice in one night. He decided to wait ten more minutes, and if she didn&rsquo;t show, he&rsquo;d leave.</p>
<p>Why&rsquo;d she leave now? They were having so much fun. He knows he was. She seemed happy too. The movie&rsquo;s still rolling, she wanted to see it so bad, and she was all about that popcorn. Where the hell is she?</p>
<p>Today he&rsquo;s been a screwed up three times. First Kenzie, then Gina, and now Jenny. Kenzie, his little sister, whatever she does doesn&rsquo;t hit him hard. Little devil got jealous because he talked about Gina in front of her. He knows Kenzie&rsquo;s got a crush on him. He probably deserved it, teasing her after she did him a great favor helping with his homework.</p>
<p>Michael shuffled around the lobby, staring at his feet, replaying the day in his mind. He strated finding excuses for Gina too. He hit on her knowing she had a boyfriend, then got jis ass handed to him in front of her. Would Gina stand up for a jerk like him against her boyfriend? She tried for a second, then switched sides. Can he blame her? Does he?</p>
<p>Of all the shit tonight, Jenny ditching him was the worst. Why, you ask?</p>
<p style='font-size: 50px;' class="Michael">BECAUSE I WANTED TO WATCH THE FUCKING MOVIE</p>
<p>If he hadn&rsquo;t seen her, if he hadn&rsquo;t sat next to her, he&rsquo;d be enjoying the movie now. But no, he had to be nice, entertain her too, and she decided to punish him for it.</p>
<p>Does he blame Jenny? He pushed some boundaries. Everyone&rsquo;s got boundaries. He wouldn&rsquo;t like it if someone pushed his. He doesn&rsquo;t like getting punched, kicked, mocked, and robbed. He wouldn&rsquo;t react well if someone crossed his lines.</p>
<p>So, it wasn&rsquo;t Gina or Jenny&rsquo;s fault. Was it his? What could he have done differently? What&rsquo;s the lesson here? He can&rsquo;t let this night pass without learning something. He can&rsquo;t let it happen again. But what? He didn&rsquo;t know Rick would show up at Gina&rsquo;s, and he didn&rsquo;t know Jenny lacked the common sense and dignity to tell him she was leaving. She&rsquo;s not normal. No one normal would do that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. No life lesson here. Just bad luck, his kind of luck. This night might as well not have happened. He&rsquo;ll sleep and be the same guy tomorrow, just a little weaker, with less self-respect.</p>
<p>He checked his watch. he&rsquo;d been waiting for Jenny in the lobby for over twenty minutes, lost in his thoughts, not feeling the time slip by.</p>

<p>His devoted slave lifted her skirt up revealing her naked pussy beneath. He poked at the wet spot, feeling her soaking pussy lips. Sherrie hummed, moving her hips slightly to meet his touch. He inserted the tip of his finger in her vagina and felt it from the inside. Sherrie shrieked and let out a moan. Michael sneered at her.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Hold it!</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Mmm. Yes, master.</p>
<p>Sleep tugged at him, but the sensation on his fingers intrigued him. When he drenched his finger in Sherrie&rsquo;s viscous pussy-honey, he liked the the touch. The smell clinging to his skin even more. He wanted more of it.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Sherrie, come here on the couch.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Yes, master, yes, master!</p>

<p>Sherrie eagerly lay on the couch. He made her open her legs so he could shove his middle finger inside her again.</p>
${storyVideo(29)}
<p>He fingered Sherrie on the couch. Her moans gradually became sultier and louder but she was naturally careful not to be too loud. <span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Oh, thank you, master, I&rsquo;ve been waiting all day. Ahh!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Thanks for what exactly? You&rsquo;re still not allowed to cum.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> What, master?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Don not cum, slave!</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> But, master I can&rsquo;t control it. Ahhhh!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Oh yes, you can, you just need to practice it more. Just keep breathing and go to the gym and you&rsquo;ll be good.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> No, masteee-Ahhh. I can&rsquo;t!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Why not? If I can hold it, you can!</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Because it feels so good, master.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> I&rsquo;m feeling great too. Don&rsquo;t you dare fucking cum!</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Women are different, master!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> You&rsquo;re nothing but treacherous creatures. I&rsquo;m sick of you manipulating me and playing me.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> No, master, I&rsquo;m honest.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> You&rsquo;re a liar! You&rsquo;re just waiting for the moment I show weakness and you&rsquo;ll stab me!</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Oh, master, please let me cum, I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> You are not allowed to cum!</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Why, master? What did I do? I&rsquo;ve been loyal to you and did everything you told me.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> You did nothing but confuse me. I thought you&rsquo;d teach me how to deal with women and you made it worse.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I don&rsquo;t deserve this punishment, sir, I can&rsquo;t stop myself from cumming.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Oh, this is not a punishment. This is only for my pleasure. Am I dominant to you now? Is that what dominance is?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> No, master, that&rsquo;s sadistic! I can&rsquo;t!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Do. Not. Cum. Or I&rsquo;ll throw you away! I don&rsquo;t even need you!</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Master, please, please, please, I beg you, I beg you. Please let me cum. I wanna cum. I&rsquo;m gonna cum. Ahhhhhh!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> I can&rsquo;t stop myself now, Sherrie. I want to stop but my finger won&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t beg me, beg my finger!</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> It&rsquo;s not your finger, master, it&rsquo;s your tongue. Your words are killing me!</p>
<p>Moans got more frequent and louder. If he does&rsquo;t stop now, she might cum, and he doesn&rsquo;t wanna kick her out or go back on his word.</p>
${storyImage(30)}
<p>Michael pulled his finger out. Sherrie&rsquo;s head thrown back trying to catch her breath. He observed her spasms and shakes. He didn&rsquo;t know but he thought was trying to suppress an orgasm from going through. Michael understood Sherrie liked being controlled but there was no way she was enjoying herself now. This was the opposite of pleasure. He, however, was enjoying myself in a way he hadn&rsquo;t felt before. He needed more of this.</p>
${storyImage(31)}
<p>He left Sherrie on the couch and went upstairs straight to his room, ignoring her calls.</p>
