<p>Milena sauntered over to Michael, her voice light but with an undercurrent of curiosity.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">Milena:</span> Hey.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Hey, what&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p><span class="Milena">Milena:</span> The usual. What&rsquo;s up with you?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Nothing.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">Milena:</span> You look different today.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Yeah, I just... hit a pole, I guess.</p>
<p>Michael touched the purple bruise on his face absentmindedly.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">Milena:</span> Nah, there&rsquo;s something strange about you today. And I&rsquo;m not talking about the puffy face. What did you get up to after I left?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Dude, you wouldn&rsquo;t believe it. Last night was WILD!</p>
<p>Milena was all in now, eyes wide, curiosity piqued.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">Milena:</span> Yeah?!! What happened?!</p>
<p>But the bell rang, cutting her off. Timing, always the damn timing.</p>

<p>Crowds. The usual shuffle of feet and chatter, everyone rushing to class like they actually care. Michael, moving through the throng, bumped into someone&mdash;books flew everywhere.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> You okay?</p>
${storyImageRight('jenny_hall')}
<p>Jenny, poor Jenny. She was trembling like she was about to fall apart, already on the ground, gathering her scattered books like they were preciou. She didn&rsquo;t answer him, just moved like a mouse under a broom.</p>
<p>Michael&rsquo;s guilt was instant. He crouched down to help.</p>
<p>He grabbed one of her notebooks, and that&rsquo;s when Jenny froze. She washolding a book, about to put it in her bag, but the second she saw him with her stuff, she just stopped. Dropped the book like it was hot, stood abruptly and stepped back. Like she was allergic to human interaction.</p>
<p>She allowed Michael to finish picking up her things on his own. Her shoulders hunched in as she waited awkwardly, too shy to even glance his way.</p>
<p>Michael noticed the avoidance. To say Jenny was shy would be an understatement. She waspractically invisible in her own skin, as if she&rsquo;d been trying to make herself small enough to disappear.</p>
<p>He never saw her talk to or make eye contact with anyone but the teachers. When Michael hit her, he automatically felt the mishap was on his part, but seeing it was Jenny, he thought it must&rsquo;ve been her fault&mdash;she was generally very clumsy.</p>
<p>He picked up all her books, notebooks, and the pen that slid away to the wall, and stood up to hand them to her.</p>
<p>She did&rsquo;t look up, eyes fixed firmly on the floor. A habit of hers, save for interactions with authority figures.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">Jenny:</span> Th-thank you.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> You&rsquo;re welcome!</p>
<p>Michael saw the tinted hue on her cheeks. He smiled. Extended his hands, offering the books back. Jenny was grateful even though she didn&rsquo;t see his smile. He was happy to hand her her books back, but the fact that she didn&rsquo;t even look him in the face irritated him. He was nice to her and acted very gently towards her. He deserved some acknowledgment for it, he believed. A mere sad &rdquo;thank you&rdquo; under the breath did&rsquo;t cut it for him. He wanted her to look him in the eyes and smile gratefully.</p>
<p>She mumbled something close to a thank you each time she picked up a thing from the stack and buried it in her pack, but her voice was buried is in her throat. Her cheeks flushed redder by the second. She was almost done, still not meeting his eyes. Not even once. A muscle ticked in his jaw as a thought crossed his mind. He&rsquo;d always found it too easy to get a rise out of her. Maybe he should.</p>
<p>He held onto the last book, just out of her reach. Jenny tried to grab it, but he moved it, just a little, just enough to mess with her. She didn&rsquo;t complain, didn&rsquo;t even look mad. She just kept reaching, like it was all part of the deal.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">Jenny:</span> Umm&hellip; please give me my things back.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> They&rsquo;re right here. Take them.</p>
<p>She reached out for the books again but they eluded her. She was teased and annoyed, but good miserable Jenny didn&rsquo;t complain. She attempted once more, only to be frustrated further by Michael&rsquo;s playful maneuvering; he moved the book again, higher this time, testing her determination.</p>
<p>Without missing a beat, her hand followed the book. Jenny, short as hell, stretched on her tiptoes, but it was no use. She was too small. She started whining.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">Jenny:</span> Michael, why are you doing this? I didn&rsquo;t do anything to you.</p>
<p>Oh, she knew who he was. Knew what he used to do. Just as much as he knew her. Jenny had been in his class since the day he joined this school. This wasn&rsquo;t the first time he teased her like that. He doesn&rsquo;t know why it felt so satisfying to incite a reaction from a bland person and Jenny was the blandest person of them all.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">Milena:</span> Michael, stop bullying her! Go take someone your size.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Stay out of this, Milena, she&rsquo;s fine. Come on, Jenny, you&rsquo;re almost there.</p>
<p>Her eyes! Never once up at him. They flicked around&mdash;floor, books, his chest, left and right, she looked high up&mdash;but never accidentally his face. How could you be so close to someone and never have the impulse to look in their eyes. To him, this couldn&rsquo;t be normal. Her eyes moved in all directions and all this time they expertly evaded his. It angered him.</p>
<p>Jenny reached again, desperation crawling up her spine.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">Jenny:</span> Michael, please.</p>
<p>Words came out of her mouth so softly, almost like a hum.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Here, let me help you.</p>
<p>He slipped his hand around her waist, pulled her in close and pressed her into him. The contact was immediate, her body stiffening against his, her breath coming in short gasps. And that&rsquo;s when it happens&mdash;right there and then, while he was basically hugging her with one arm, Jenny looked at his face.</p>
<p>For a split second, their gazes lock. Her eyes twitched rapidly in their places. It feltweird and unnatural. He remembered a teacher saying Jenny had extra electricity in her brain and that&rsquo;s what caused her eyes to move like that against her will. It was a subtle movement but it was quite noticeable and slightly hypnotic.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had heard that the brain electricity thing was quite dangerous and Jenny underwent more than one brain surgery because of it, and she frequently takes medications during classes. I think that&rsquo;s why she wasn&rsquo;t bullied that much, given how weak and vulnerable she is. Most people actually felt bad for Jenny, and she was given the treatment of a special or &ldquo;disabled&rdquo; kid. Over the years, she didn&rsquo;t have many friends. I could count on one hand the number of girls I saw her talk to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That was the note he stored in his schoolbook.</p>
<p>While everybody in the school gave Jenny a special treatment, he didn&rsquo;t see anything special about her. Able or not, diseased or not, no one deserved to be treated special in his school.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he thought.</p>
<p>Her eyes dance in their place? So fucking what? She&rsquo;s not gonna drop dead on the floor if I tease her a little bit. Same way I wouldn&rsquo;t drop to the floor if Kelsi or a jock kicked me in the guts. Jenny is struggling in front of me because she&rsquo;s shy and short and I&rsquo;m tall and confident. Her brain electricity isn&rsquo;t a factor in this game at all. I would&rsquo;ve done the same thing to Ned if it was him who hit me while I was walking. Poor Ned doesn&rsquo;t even have a brain, why isn&rsquo;t he treated special?</p>
<p>His thoughts are vile sometimes.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">Jenny:</span> No, no, no, no, no...</p>
<p>He saw the fear in her eyes, still twitching like mad, and he felt her body trembling against him. Having got half what he wanted, he relented. He wanted her glance in his eyes and a smile. She&rsquo;was panicking in his arms&mdash;he lost faith in cracking a smile on that face any time soon.</p>
<p>Michael loosened his grip and lowered the book into her hands.</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">Jenny:</span> Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s face blushed so hard she looked like a goddamn tomato. She snatched the book from him, like it was the last piece of her dignity. She muttered a string of thanks, face buried in the book she clutched like a shield.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Don&rsquo;t I deserve an apology too?</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">Jenny:</span> I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>He wished she&rsquo;d asked him why he made her apologize, like a normal person would&mdash;so he could tease her a little bit longer. He wouldn&rsquo;t have had time to do that if she gave him the chance.</p>
${storyImageLeft('kelsi_hall')}
<p><span class="Kelsi">Kelsi:</span> What the hell do you think you&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>Kelsi appeared suddenly and she was pissed. Michael, absorbed in teasing Jenny, failed to notice her approach. Swiftly, he positioned Jenny between himself and Kelsi, using her like a shield.</p>
<p>Jenny, taken aback, offered no resistance, only a timid whimper escaping her lips.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> What? I was just helping Jenny.</p>
<p><span class="Kelsi">Kelsi:</span> Give her her stuff back, asshole.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Already did, officer.</p>
<p>A couple of students around him laughed. As Kelsi injected herself into the situation, he received attention. Kelsi, unentertained by his jest, bristled at being mocked.</p>
<p><span class="Kelsi">Kelsi:</span> Save me your shitty humor, Michael. If you wanna be funny, go annoy someone else, I won&rsquo;t stop you. Anyone but Jenny. Why her, man? That&rsquo;s too low, even for you.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Why her? Well, look at her. She looks like shit, she smells like shit, and overall she&rsquo;s a giant piece of shit. I have shitty humor. We&rsquo;re a match made in heaven.</p>
<p>He got a loud pop from the crowd. The whole damn place erupted. He hadn&rsquo;t figured on so many people watching, but it seemed like everyone in the hall at that moment heard him and they were laughing their heads off. Even Milena, who had been against the ruckus from the beginning, was doubled over, laughing like she&rsquo;d never heard a joke in her life. The only three not joining in were him, Kelsi, and poor Jenny. Jenny buried her miserable face in her palms, Kelsi&rsquo;s face turned as dark as hell, and him... well, he never laughed at his own jokes.</p>
<p><span class="Kelsi">Kelsi:</span> Step aside, Jenny. I&rsquo;m gonna kill him!</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">Jenny:</span> Please don&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t fight.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t see that coming. Kelsi tried to go around Jenny but Jenny stood in her way and clasped to her shirt, begging her to forgive him.</p>
<p><span class="Kelsi">Kelsi:</span> I&rsquo;m serious! He&rsquo;s gonna apologize. And kiss your feet.</p>
<p style='font-size: 30px; font-weight:500'>Kiss her feet! Kiss her feet!</p>
<p>His heart skipped a beat. Kelsi doesn&rsquo;t joke or exaggerate. Not only that, the crowd chanted and demanded he kissed Jenny&rsquo;s feet. He gave Milena the dead eye. Bitch was literally jumping in the air from excitement.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">Milena:</span> KISS HER FOOT NOW!</p>
<p><span class="Jenny">Jenny:</span> Kelsi, please, I don&rsquo;t wanna get in trouble.</p>

<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Hey.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">Milena:</span> So what happened to you last night? I&rsquo;m dying to know.</p>
<p>He was sure of that. She&rsquo;d nagged him about it the whole day.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> It&rsquo;s a long story.</p>
<p><span class="Milena">Milena:</span> So it won&rsquo;t fit in my short head?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> (sigh) Alright, I&rsquo;ll tell you on the way home. But you have to promise not to tell anyone, not even your mother!</p>
<p><span class="Milena">Milena:</span> Yeah, yeah, for sure. I&rsquo;m good at keeping secrets.</p>
<p>That was a lie. She and he know quite well that she couldn&rsquo;t keep a secret from her mother even if her life depended on it.</p>
<p>For some ungodly reason, she told her mother everything. Everything. They were as thick as thieves. He had never met her mom, but every time Milena talked about her, it didn&rsquo;t sound like a mother-daughter thing. In all of Milena&rsquo;s stories, they acted like best friends. It was something he never related to or understood himself, being so close to your parents. Maybe it was a European thing.</p>
<p>Michael walked Milena home. Told her what happened the previous day with Roberts and Kelsi but left out the wild part out, Sherrie.</p>

<p>Michael entered our house and immediately went around looking for Sherrie. He was beyond happy to catch her in the living room.</p>
<p>She smiled at his sight.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Sherrie. Bedroom. Now.</p>

<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Yes, master, did you need me?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Sherrie, do you remember what we talked about yesterday?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Yes, sir. I believe you wanted to use my pussy for your enjoyment.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> I&rsquo;m sure you will enjoy it too.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> It doesn&rsquo;t matter, sir. Your wish is for me to take your virginity and I will fulfill your wish no matter what. Would you like me to take your clothes off, master?</p>
<p>He appreciated the roleplay but that was going a little bit over the top. He was a horny teenager and this was his first real sex time. What the hell did he need roleplay for? He just wanted to fuck!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> I&rsquo;ll take my clothes off myself. I, uhh... Sherrie I want to ask you something first.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Anything.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Yesterday when I said I wanted to use you so I could lose my virginity... I didn&rsquo;t really mean that. I was just horny and all my blood was in my cock, I had nothing in my brain but my desire to fuck you, so I couldn&rsquo;t explain myself. I would love to fuck you a lot, you&rsquo;re an extremely hot woman.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Thank you, master.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> But you didn&rsquo;t seem to mind it at all. In fact, I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that you kind of liked that.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I did like that.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s a little... derogatory?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Oh, sir, to be used by you as a mere cum rag? That excites me a lot!</p>
<p>This is waaaaaay too much.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Why are you acting like this?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Acting like what, master?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Acting like I&rsquo;m your master, Sherrie! Ahem, sorry, didn&rsquo;t mean to shout at you. It&rsquo;s just I can&rsquo;t wrap my head around this whole thing. You don&rsquo;t act like other servants or maids I&rsquo;ve seen in my friends&rsquo; houses. It&rsquo;s something that has always intrigued me. You act so differently. You know, Kelsi and I used to joke about it. We used to call you Dad&rsquo;s slave.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I used to be your dad&rsquo;s slave. Now I belong to you, master.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Cut that crap for a minute, Sherrie, I&rsquo;m serious!</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I&rsquo;m not joking, master. I am a slave. I have given myself completely to your father, and he has passed me to you.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> But... Isn&rsquo;t slavery illegal?!</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> The laws that govern this city do not apply to this house, sir.</p>
<p>He still remembers that statement very clearly. It took him a long, long time to finally understand what Sherrie meant by it. He should have asked Sherrie to explain it then, but he didn&rsquo;t. He was astonished and disgusted at the same time. His mind went blank. As a teenager, he didn&rsquo;t have the mental faculties to understand what slavery was. He didn&rsquo;t know what was going on. But he had a strong feeling inside him at that moment. He felt it deep in his guts. Pure disgust.</p>

<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> You&rsquo;re free.</p>
<p>Sherrie stared at him in silence.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> I&rsquo;m not a slavemaster. I don&rsquo;t own you and I don&rsquo;t wish to own anybody in my life. You&rsquo;re free to leave this house and live your own life from now on. Sherrie, you&rsquo;re free.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> But, master, if I wanted to leave, I would have done so a long time ago. I&rsquo;m not held here against my will.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> What do you mean? Why would you willingly give yourself to someone else?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Master, I&rsquo;ll explain everything to you if you wish. Before I go on, I would like you to know that I am indeed different from most people that you know. However, there are people like me, who derive immense sexual and intellectual pleasure from seizing control to someone else. Master, you told your father yesterday that you wanted to learn about women, right?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> I do. Honestly, right now I feel like I don&rsquo;t know anything about women at all!</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> You should know that I am not a representative of all women. In fact, I am sure you have never seen a woman like me before, and probably never will, but there are some. I know you want to learn about women so you&rsquo;d know how to deal with the girls in your school, which is very natural for a boy with a high libido like you. However, the things I will teach you may not be applicable to the girls in your school. I am an extreme case. If you go around treating girls your age the way I like to be treated, you will get in trouble.</p>
<p>There was a different air about her. A couple of minutes ago, she acted like a slave, and now she carries this poise about her while she spoke. Is she really a slave? Or is she toying with him? He wondered. <span class="Michael">Michael:</span> I want to know everything about you, Sherrie. Don&rsquo;t hold anything from me.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I don&rsquo;t know how my mind works but I will try to explain it as much as I can, master.</p>

<p>Sherrie went ahead and told him about herself. Being truly his slave, she held nothing back and went into extreme detail on how and why she is what she is. Her &lsquo;lesson&rsquo;, if we could call it that, was not about the act of sex itself in the physical sense, as Michal had originally wanted to learn. He basically wanted to learn how to fuck, and that was all. Instead, he found something else, something he felt like he&rsquo;d been looking for for a long time.</p>
<p>While Sherrie&rsquo;s &lsquo;lecture&rsquo; was mainly about Sherrie, and by extension the small subset of women who were extremely submissive, it gave him a huge insight into how men and women work. It was eye-opening, mind-shattering. For all my intents and purposes, this, ladies and gentlemen, was Michael&rsquo;s first sex lesson.</p>

<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I surrendered myself to him completely. I am nothing but his slave, a puppet dancing on his strings. He held the power over me, able to mold and manipulate my body and mind as he saw fit. I found solace in this twisted arrangement, all my needs were fulfilled and every decision was made for me. I am like a child in his hands. I have no care in the world and no responsibility at all.</p>
${storyImage('S/1')}
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Are you talking about Dad?</p>
<p>Sherrie didn&rsquo;t answer him. Talked like she was in a trance.</p>
${storyImage('S/3')}
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I was raised a Mormon. I was very religious when I was young and I would have loved to live a religious life, but my mother and I weren&rsquo;t really embraced by the people in the church, because of our Asian blood. My mother came from East Asia she only converted her religion to marry Dad, she didn&rsquo;t care about religion, all she wanted was to fit in this society. I cared in the beginning, but the Mormon Church didn&rsquo;t.</p>
${storyImageCenter('S/4')}
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I still grew up a fairly typical teenager. I started dating in high school, and just like all the other girls, I would go out with a boy and make out with him and let him touch me, but always pull out at the last second, before either of us was really satisfied.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> It&rsquo;s something that all the girls my age did at the time. I dated a good bunch throughout high school. I was a very smart and popular girl in high school. I had my way easy because I was a lot smarter than my age, and I was very good at manipulating people, especially the horny boys.</p>
${storyImage('S/1')}
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I would constantly tease a boy and tantalize him with bits and pieces of what he likes, a kiss here, a touch there, a kiss and a touch here and there, but never allow myself or him to get what we really wanted in the end. I was deeply afraid of losing my virginity. I attribute that to my Christian upbringing. The Virgin Mary was the mother of Christ, and she&rsquo;s the one we were supposed to look up to. I had completely given up on religion and God since I was at least 12, but in the back of my mind, I still associated my virginity with purity. I was only going to give away my virginity to someone special.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I finally gave in and lost my virginity to a boy in the last year of high school. I thought I loved that boy, but it was just&nbsp;my hormones acting up and playing with my head convincing me it&rsquo;s ok to have sex. We broke up before we went off to college. In college, I dated&nbsp;a bit more than I did in high school. I did not have guilt or fear associated with sex anymore, and I slept with a lot of men, half-men I should say, none of them could really satisfy me.</p>
${storyImage('S/5')}
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> In college, I played the same games as in high school. I was always in control. I would tell the boy how far he could go, and if the boy was lucky, one day I would let them have me, but only on my terms. I could get my hands on any man I wanted in college. I might not look like it now, but I had this inescapable charm about me and I could captivate any man I chose.</p>
${storyImage('S/6')}
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> That until I met him in the third year of college. By then, I had thought I could read any man I could land my eyes on. I couldn&rsquo;t read him, however. William Alexander was unlike any man I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Dad!</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Your father is a true genius. I saw the way you talked to him yesterday, you don&rsquo;t seem to know his works and achievements towards humanity. Your father is one of the greatest men alive. I&rsquo;m sure one day he will go as one of the most important men in history.</p>
${storyImage('S/7')}
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> But let me tell you about that time in college. On the outlook, William wasn&rsquo;t my kind of guy. He was unbelievably quiet and he didn&rsquo;t talk to anybody. Except for his friend Adrian.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I was introduced to William and Adrian by Dr. James Haworth, one of the most respected and influential physicists of the 20th century. Dr. Haworth selected the 3 top students in the physics and mathematics departments in college to work on a project that he supervised by his own great self. That&rsquo;s how William, Adrian, and I came to know each other. The boys were my age, but I hadn&rsquo;t really seen them before then. William and Adrian joined no sororities, went to no parties, partook in no college activities whatsoever, and were even given lease to skip classes they didn&rsquo;t need.</p>
${storyImage('S/6')}
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> When I was introduced to your father by my professor, I was mesmerized by him. I did not believe love at first sight existed. When I first met your father and shook his hands, I felt a tingle down my spine, and a warm glow climbed up to my head. If that wasn&rsquo;t love, there is no love.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Your father was a visionary. His eyes were bigger than the world. The whole project was his idea and it was led by him. Andrian and I and Dr. Haworth even were only his assistants, and we did our best to keep up with him. He didn&rsquo;t speak much, but when he spoke, people listened as if their lives depended on it. It wasn&rsquo;t uncommon for him to speak and suggest an idea or a solution to a dilemma or a question he was asked, only for us to discover that his solution had never been suggested before and that the question he had just answered was an unsolved mystery for a long time!</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I have never met a man like William Alexander in my life. Never thought such a man could exist. I was obsessed with him. I thought of him day and night, in every waking moment. I loved him deeply and I loved him truly, more than I thought I could ever love. I wanted him.</p>

<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> William, Adrian, and I quickly became friends. I tried many many times to get your father to look at me as more than just a friend, but no matter how charming or beautiful or sexy or naughty I tried to be in front of him, I could never get him to take me as a love interest. I could get any man in this college under my feet, no matter how young or old they were, how smart or stupid, ugly or fit they were. I could get anyone I wanted, except the one I wanted most.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I couldn&rsquo;t get to your father&rsquo;s heart, so I decided to play with the only heart he trusted, his best friend Adrian.</p>
${storyImageCenter('S/9')}
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Adrian was extremely smart, but he was also a player. I teased him a couple of times and he understood the gestures quickly. He<br />asked me out once he noticed I had an interest in him, and we went on our first date.</p>
<p>(Developer's Note: Sherrie and Adrian's first date is a replication of a scene from the masterpiece <em>Growing UP A Master</em> by MWTB, a nod to a story that affected me a lot and inspired many aspects of this story.)</p>

${storyImageCenter('S/10')}

<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> We went to see a play, and as soon as we sat down, Adrian wrapped his arm around me, pulling me close. There was no hesitation, no testing the waters&mdash;just pure confidence. Other men would have been more cautious. They&rsquo;d slip their arm around me slowly, waiting for permission, easing me into their touch. Not Adrian. He knew what he wanted and took it without asking. I was startled at first, but I let him because it felt good.</p>
${storyImage('S/11')}

<p>The date went smoothly, and when he dropped me off at home, he kissed me goodnight. Just like his touch, his kiss was powerful, and I liked it. But when his hands slipped under my skirt, through the legholes of my panties, and squeezed my ass, something inside me pulled back. It was too much, too soon. I playfully pushed him away, smiling, teasing him to ease the tension.</p>
<p>He paused, his eyes darkening for a moment as he studied me. Then, unexpectedly, he took my hand, kissed it softly, and whispered, <span class="Adrian">&ldquo;Thank you for tonight. It was unforgettable. But&hellip; we won&rsquo;t be seeing each other again.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>He turned to leave, and I just stood there, dumbfounded. Everything had been perfect. I was sure he had enjoyed himself just as much as I did. Why was he leaving me? Panic flared in my chest, and I called out, <span class="Sherrie">&ldquo;Wait! Why? What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Adrian stopped but didn&rsquo;t turn around. His voice was steady, controlled. <span class="Adrian">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t play games, Sherrie.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>My heart pounded. <span class="Sherrie">&ldquo;What games? I&rsquo;m not playing with you, Adrian.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="Adrian">&ldquo;Oh, but you are.&rdquo;</span> He finally turned. <span class="Adrian">&ldquo;You let me get close, but only just. You let me kiss you, touch you, but only on your terms. You&rsquo;ll play the innocent girl and tease, give just enough to keep me coming back, but never enough to let me in. You want me, Sherrie, but you won&rsquo;t admit it. And if I keep playing along, one day, after I&rsquo;ve earned it, you&rsquo;ll finally let me under your skirt.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>His words cut deep, piercing through the thin veil of control I&rsquo;d thought I had. He was right, but I couldn&rsquo;t let him know that.</p>
<p><span class="Adrian">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t play that game,&rdquo;</span> he continued, stepping closer, his presence overwhelming. <span class="Adrian">&ldquo;I want you. You want me. But I won&rsquo;t be toyed with. When you&rsquo;re ready to be honest with yourself, call me. Until then&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>He turned and walked away, leaving me standing in the doorway, speechless. My heart raced as the truth settled over me. He was right&mdash;I wanted him, desperatel, so desperately I was dripping wet between my legs.</p>
${storyImage('S/1')}
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Dripping wet?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> It's when a woman is really excited.</p>
<p>I wanted Adrian but I didn&rsquo;t know how to stop playing the game.</p>
<p>I spent the rest of the night tossing and turning, thinking about him, about what he said. I couldn&rsquo;t get him out of my head. Finally, I gave in. I called him, I remember my voice trembling with fear as he answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; I whispered into the phone. <span class="Sherrie">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t play games anymore.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>His silence was heavy, and for a moment, I thought he&rsquo;d hang up. But then, he spoke. <span class="Adrian">&ldquo;You left me hanging, Sherrie, and for no reason. I&rsquo;ll give you one more chance, but you&rsquo;ll have to prove it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">&ldquo;I will,&rdquo;</span> I said, breathless, eager.</p>
<p><span class="Adrian">&ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo;</span> he said, his voice low and commanding.<span class="Adrian"> &ldquo;When I pick you up, I don&rsquo;t want you wearing any underwear. I will check if you did what I asked you and if so I'll take you out again. And if we both have a good time, I&rsquo;ll take you home, then I'll take yourclothes off and fuck you. If you can&rsquo;t handle it, just be wearing underwear when I get there.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> What the fuck?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> That's what I thought too.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> He wanted you to go to college without underwear?!!!</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span>&nbsp;No, Adrian was a wild man, but even he wasn't crazy enough to ask me something so humiliating and unpractical to do. He wanted me to go with him on a date after college wearing no underwear. Which was still a stretch for me. I knew I had to tell him no.</p>
<p>The line went dead, leaving me crazy with anticipation. I wanted to fall asleep but I couldn't, I kept thinking of Adrian, and before I knew it, I started masturbating. I must've masturbated half a dozen times that night thinking of him.</p>
<p>The next day was a blur. I went to class, but all I could think about was Adrian. When I saw him on campus, he acted like nothing had happened, like we hadn&rsquo;t shared that intense conversation. I wanted to tell him I couldn&rsquo;t do this, that we were done, but the words wouldn&rsquo;t come.</p>
${storyImage('S/11')}

<p>That night, when he arrived at my door, I hesitated for a moment, my heart pounding and my legs begging to escaep. But then, without thinking, I grabbed my skirt and showed him my naked pussy underneath.</p>
<p>He smiled, that devastating smile, and took me out. The evening was perfect, and though I felt exposed, Adrian acted like everything was under his control.</p>
<p>When he brought me home, he kept his promise. And gave me the most incredible fuck of my life up to that point.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Adrian was a truly dominant man. He wanted to control me and seize power over me. I enjoyed giving up myself to him completely, allowing him to do wonders to my mind and body. Our sex life was very wild. We did things that I am sure will scar your mind if you knew about them, but with enough time, I will introduce you to them.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> You see, master. There are two kinds of people in this world. Those who are dominant and those who are submissive. I am of the submissive kind. I attribute that to my childhood and upbringing. I had no shame or guilt in whatever Adrian did to me because it wasn&rsquo;t really my choice. With time, our sex became harder and rougher.</p>
${storyImage('S/13')}
<p>And one day, almost a year after we started dating, I woke up in Adrian&rsquo;s bed and found myself tied to his bed, stripped from all my clothes.</p>
${storyImageRight('S/12')}
<p><span class="Adrian">Adrian:</span> Good morning, my Sherrie.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Adrian, what&rsquo;s going on, babe, why am I tied?</p>
<p>Then I saw Adrian grab a whip that he had put on a table in the room.</p>
<p><span class="Adrian">Adrian:</span> Darling, do you love me?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Of course, Adrian. I love you more than the whole world.</p>
<p><span class="Adrian">Adrian:</span> That&rsquo;s a lie!</p>
<p>And then he whipped my chest. I screamed and I cried. I begged Adrian to let me go or tell me why he did this to me.</p>
<p><span class="Adrian">Adrian:</span> If you truly loved me, would do you say another man&rsquo;s name in my bed?</p>
<p>Adrian knew about my love and desire for your father. Many times have I screamed your father&rsquo;s name while Adrian fucked me without even realizing that I did so. Adrian tried to let it go, given how dominant he was over me, he didn&rsquo;t feel the urge to prove his manhood to me or himself, but that night I uttered your father&rsquo;s name one too many times in my sleep. I begged Adrian to forgive me, but he had no mercy in his heart. He gagged my mouth to silence my cries of pain and whipped me as hard as he could.</p>
<p><span class="Adrian">Adrian:</span> I gave you 10 whips, one for each time you called his name in your sleep. Now, this, this is for lying to me.</p>
<p>Adrian untied my legs, folded me so that my legs were hooked behind my head, shoved the whip handle inside my ass, and then took his clothes off and fucked my pussy.</p>
${storyImage('S/1')}
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Umm, Sherrie?</p>
${storyImage('S/13')}
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> He warned me that if the whip got out of my ass, he would whip me again. So I had to clench my asshole so it stays tight around the whip handle and it wouldn&rsquo;t slip out while he rammed me. It was very difficult and humiliating and painful, agonizing even, but I enjoyed it.</p>
${storyImage('S/14')}
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I discovered I had this predilection to being tied and forced. My earliest memories of my childhood was a time when I was four years old playing cowboys and robbers with a bunch of other kids. I was tied to a tree by a clothesline waiting for a kid to come and free me from jail. The rope was tied by one of the older kids and it was tied pretty roughly.<br />I felt very uncomfortable.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> A couple of minutes passed without anyone passing by me and I got scared. I struggled to free myself but I couldn&rsquo;t no matter how hard I tried. I looked up to the sky. I was a curious child and I had a colorful imagination. The world felt so big around me. I wanted to run around and explore the world. It was such a loss to be trapped like this.<br />I wanted to be free!</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I panicked. I was in pain. I cried and screamed until I was finally saved by one of the kids&rsquo; parents. It was an awful and horrible experience. I don&rsquo;t how long it was, probably less than 10 minutes, but to little me it felt like hours.</p>
<p>As awful and horrible as it was, for that whole time, all my senses were heightened, I felt alive, that&rsquo;s why I hold this memory very dear to my heart. As I grew up, I started to miss the blissful consciousness of childhood, I craved those episodes of extra awareness that I had sometimes when I was a child, I craved that feeling of being alive.</p>
${storyImage('S/13')}
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> And right there and then, while I wept and wailed while Adrian fucked me, I was alive. Tied and bound and forced I was, but I was... free. I was free of my hate for myself, free of all the guilts I had in my life, free of all faults.</p>
<p>It was hard to keep the whip handle in my ass while Adrian pumped me.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Sherrie, please.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I tried to keep it in as best I could. I tried to stop myself from reaching orgasm because I knew all my muscles would let loose the handle would slip out, and I would be whipped to death. It was practically impossible to hold the whip handle inside my anus for the whole duration Adrian fucked me.</p>
${storyImageCenter('S/15')}
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I came a lot that day. I could keep the whip handle inside me while I came very few times, but most times it did slip out, and I was deservedly whipped for it. After whipping the entire front of my body, Adrian untied the rope from the bed, flipped me over on my stomach, then hogtied me, arms and legs, and whipped my whole back. After that, he shoved the whip handle in my destroyed pussy, and then drove his cock in my-</p>
${storyImage('S/1')}
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Sherrie!</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Yes, master.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> That&rsquo;s enough. I appreciate you going into extreme detail but... How is all this supposed to help me with women?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I thought you wanted to tell me about me, master.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Tell me about Dad, and how you got here.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I will do so right away, sir.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Ok, sorry, I have a question first. You said you were whipped hard that day.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Oh, yes sir. At least a hundred times.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Damn! But... I never saw any scars on you.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Well, I told you were scientists, didn&rsquo;t I? It happened that were working on a cream and an injection that facilitated tissue repair without leaving scars. We specialized in physics and mathematics but we innovated a little bit out of our fields occasionally. I took the chance to test one of our inventions and it worked like a miracle. It took a couple of months for the wounds to heal. I remember having to cover my whole body the whole time when I went out, arms and legs included to hide the wounds, but when the wounds healed, they didn&rsquo;t leave a single mark on my body.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Wow. Why have I never heard of such a thing?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> It requires some rare and expensive ingredients and only the most powerful and resourceful in this society know about let alone have access to it.</p>
<p>Micahel was lost for words.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Sherrie, I wanna know more about you and how you came here but... save me from the rough stuff.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> From that day I told you about, I surrendered myself to Adrian completely. He showed me what it means to be truly submissive, and that&rsquo;s how I found true pleasure and ecstasy. I became his slave, a mere puppet on his strings. He held the power over me and did whatever he wanted to me and I did whatever he wanted without fail. He chose what I dressed like, when to eat, when to use the bathroom, when I could be fucked, and even when he fucked me he determined whether I could cum or not. He wanted me to get on my knees, I got on my knees instantly and opened my ass for him-</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Ahem.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Oh, sorry. I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m like this. I enjoy pain and humiliation to the fullest. I tried to learn about sex and love and I studied them, trying to demystify my sexuality. I thought it was my childhood, and part of it was mainly because of my childhood, but I discovered I was born like this. It&rsquo;s in my genes.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> A year later, Adrian and I married. Up to that point, I was Adrian&rsquo;s slave by choice, there was a lot of fear involved but I always had the choice to leave him if I wanted and I didn&rsquo;t. I did love him and I wanted him. However, when he proposed to me and introduced me to his family. It was part of accepting him as my husband that I would sell my soul to him. Adrian came from a very powerful family with a long lineage. Our marriage wasn&rsquo;t Christian, neither Adrian nor I were. When I accepted Adrian as my husband, I signed a contract that I became his property and he would do with me what he wished.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I lived very happily with Adrian and his family in their big house. When I married Adrian, I had cut all ties with the outside world. I was employed by my college by then and I resigned from my position and left.</p>
${storyImage('S/16')}
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Your father was shocked to see me leave. He was well aware of my passion for science and knowledge and we were really close friends by then. He saw me as an asset to his research and a vital part of it. It would be such a loss for the scientific community to lose a talent like me, and more importantly, it would be a greater loss for him. It felt amazing to be praised by someone so great as him. My heart fluttered when he told me he wanted me. I wanted him too, in a different way, I wish I lived in a world where I could him my way, but I had no choice, my soul belonged to the second-best man there was.</p>
<p>Your father was disappointed, I broke his heart. I quivered at his response. He was very angry, but he didn&rsquo;t shout at me or curse me, only turned around and left, without even saying goodbye. I quivered as he let my hand go.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> <cite>All who have loved passionately have quivered at least a little, at least once, when the object of desire has cast a stormy look your way; if you haven&rsquo;t, you haven&rsquo;t loved.</cite></p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Adrian left your father&rsquo;s project too. Some animosity had grown between the two because of differences in their ideologies and methods. Adrian started his own research group and created his own lab where he worked on his own projects, powered and funded by his extremely powerful and wealthy family. I worked with him too.</p>
${storyImageCenter('S/17')}
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> For four years we worked on various projects and created many inventions that contributed a lot to the technological leap in the late 90&rsquo;s and early 2000&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Some of our work, however, was kept secret. Adrian thought some things were too good for this world and he kept them for himself and his family. Your father did the same thing too, for different reasons, your father kept to himself what he thought could be misused to cause harm in this world. Your father&rsquo;s work, however, was 10 times more advanced than<br />Adrian&rsquo;s. Adrian and I hit multiple blocks and problems in our research that Adrian knew your father had solved already.</p>
${storyImage('S/16')}
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> So he decided to make a deal with your father. Your father had just built this house and he was having his first babies, you and Master Kelsi. Adrian offered protection and promised your father that his house and his family would be protected against any harm, even from Adrian&rsquo;s family themselves, on the condition that he share his work with Adrian.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Your father declined, he told Adrian that he knew how to protect himself and his family quite well, and that if Adrian wanted his research, he&rsquo;d have to offer more than that. Knowing how revolutionary and powerful your father&rsquo;s work was, Adrian was ready to do anything. You see? The battle between Adrian and William wasn&rsquo;t just a difference of ideology, it was a battle of ego. Your dad wanted to humiliate Adrian, to prove that he was always better than him, something that Adrian knew very well to begin with.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Your father was aware of Adrian&rsquo;s family and their traditions. Adrian&rsquo;s family had an age-old tradition where if you wanted to make a deal with them, and offer someone from your family for their pleasure, your offer won&rsquo;t be refused. A tradition that has disgusted your father forever. In addition to protection, your father wanted Adrian to offer his most prized belonging... his wife.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> It was the ultimate power move. Your father proves himself dominant over Adrian, gets back at Adrian for abandoning him when he needed him most and for taking me from<br />him as well, gains a much-needed assistant and research partner in me, and smacks Adrian&rsquo;s family in the face for its horrible traditions and practices.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> How much thought Adrian gave it I don&rsquo;t know, but soon afterward, my soul was sold to your father, and I came to this house. That&rsquo;s how I became your father&rsquo;s slave. When I later saw your father&rsquo;s work, I realized Adrian made the right choice, I was a cheap price for it. Your father&rsquo;s research is going to change the world as we know it.</p>
${storyImage('S/1')}
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Does that mean Dad could do anything to you?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Does he fuck you?!!!</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Unfortunately not, master. Your father has dedicated himself to science and knowledge. He has no interest in a filthy whore like me. In fact, before your father met your mother, I thought he could not love a woman. Alas, I was wrong, completely wrong. In some magical way, your mother found a way to your father&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Well, Dad might be a great man, but every man makes mistakes.</p>
<p>Sherrie chuckled.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Wow, you&rsquo;re envious of Mom still?!</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Do you want me to answer this question, sir?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> No, but answer me this. You told me yesterday you fucked people, you know, in all shapes and sizes. You only told me about a couple of men in your life.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> When I was given to your dad, I became bound to him by a contract like the one that contracted me to Adrian before him. While I am technically not part of your father&rsquo;s family, the contract allows him to use me to get favors from Adrian&rsquo;s family. I was used by many men for the benefit of your father.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> That&rsquo;s very cruel!</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Your father lost all respect for me as a human after he learned about the truth of my relationship with Adrian, that I was a slave and a puppet. To tell you the truth, master, it gives me immense pleasure to be used like this for your father&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> That&rsquo;s straight up the craziest story I&rsquo;ve ever heard. Does Mom know all this?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> No, she knows very little about your father. To her, I&rsquo;m just your father&rsquo;s servant and assistant. Do you have any other questions, sir?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> No, that&rsquo;s... more than I wanted to know.</p>
${storyImage('S/1')}
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Are you excited for it like I am?</p>
${storyImage('S/18')}
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Mmmmm, yes, my master, very.</p>
${storyImage('S/19')}
<p>Sherrie took her skirt off, lay on the bed, and spread her legs open in front of Michael.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I&rsquo;m dripping wet.</p>
<p>She wasn&rsquo;t exaggerating. While Michael was terribly excited for it, he was also anxious about having sex.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> We can do that tomorrow. You told me a lot of stuff and I need some time to digest it. Sherrie, you can leave the room now.</p>
<p>That seemed to turn Sherrie off, but she didn&rsquo;t complain. She nodded, got up and left the room.</p>
${storyImageLeft('S/20')}
<p>Michael sprawled out in his bed, a prisoner to the sheets all day, half the night too. Sherrie&rsquo;s words bounced around his brain like a broken record. So Dad and Adrian tag-team Sherrie into submission and made a slave out of her. Was that right or wrong? Was she his victim now? Even if using her was wrong, did it mean anything after they messed her up all this long?</p>
<p>He was utterly disgusted by Dad and the way he stole Sherrie from Adrian, who he didn&rsquo;t blame much. At least Adrian married himself to Sherrie for eternity. Nothing wrong with making your wife a slave! He thought...</p>
<p>But even then how could a man sell his wife, especially one so skilled and mighty like Adrian?</p>
${storyImage('S/21')}
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t get Adrian out of his head. The guy was so cool, to him. Michael felt a spark, a damn fire. Why couldn&rsquo;t that son of a bitch be his old man? Maybe he&rsquo;d be someone worth a damn by now.</p>
