<p>He paused outside the familiar door, its faded number 307 barely visible. Clearing his throat, he fished out his keys from his pocket, only to realize he no longer had the key to this door. He thought he'd never need it again. With a sigh, he rang the doorbell.</p>

<p>The door opened with a slight groan. Her head peeked out shyly at an angle from behind the door.</p>


<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">&ldquo;Who's there?&rdquo;</span> she asked, her eyes squinting to see who was standing in the dimly lit hallway.</p>

<p><span class="GMD-Jake">&ldquo;Jake, 
<br>27 years old, 
<br>Looking for some single hot lady action tonight.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">&ldquo;Jake! Oh, Jake!&rdquo;</span> Bailey exclaimed. Flinging the door open excitedly, she hurried over to him, her arms wrapping around him in 
a tight embrace. Jake felt a wave of comfort wash over him, something he hadn't realized he missed so much.</p>

<p><span class="GMD-Jake">&ldquo;Hey, Mom,&rdquo;</span> he murmured, hugging her back. <span class="GMD-Jake">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to see you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>She pulled back, her eyes scanning his face, searching for any signs of how he was holding up. <span class="GMD-Bailey">&ldquo;How have you been doing?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>He chuckled softly. <span class="GMD-Jake">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. I&rsquo;m actually here to check on you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>She smiled, her eyes misting over as she noticed the luggage he brought with him. <span class="GMD-Bailey">&ldquo;Come in, come in!&rdquo;</span> She grabbed his hand and happily dragged him through the doorway into the living room.</p>
<p>He wheeled his luggage behind him and carelessly let it roll to a stop in the middle of the hallway. Jake slumped into one of the worn-out chairs while his mother flopped onto the couch, eyeing him curiously.</p>

<p>She bombarded him with a dozen questions in rapid succession, barely giving him time to answer one before asking the next. He told her how he had been all these years, how he had been holding up, and what he had been doing. Though he was the one curious and eager to know about her, she gave him no space to talk about anything but himself. She was so happy to see him that she saved the most obvious and pressing question for last.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">&ldquo;And what the hell brought you back?&rdquo;</span> she finally asked, in her same-old playful spirit.</p>
<p>Jake got up from the couch, spreading his arms wide, claiming as much space as possible in his new old home. <span class="GMD-Jake">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m back home,&rdquo;</span> he declared.</p>
<p>Bailey sat there, almost speechless, her mouth slightly open in disbelief. He opened his bag and took out a box containing a bottle of champagne.</p>
<p>Seeing it, Bailey cracked up laughing, then rose swiftly to snatch the bottle from his hand. She took it to the kitchen counter and nestled it into a bowl, which she then filled with ice. Bailey was a lover of fine wines. Jake had gone to great lengths to procure the most premium bottle he could afford before arriving in town.</p>
<p>However, her unimpressed gaze made it clear that his selection had missed the mark. Without a word, she opened her cupboard and pulled out one of her own vintage treasures, pouring them both a glass.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m staying with you,&rdquo;</span> he announced, feeling a bit of guilt for the hardships she endured because of him. She was ecstatic to hear that from him but she quickly turned sour when it became his turn asking questions.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">&ldquo;Is it true?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s true?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">&ldquo;That you&rsquo;re becoming a man?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">&ldquo;Yes, I should&rsquo;ve-&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">&ldquo;You should&rsquo;ve told me and asked me about it first. Why didn&rsquo;t you involve me?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">&ldquo;Why would you have an opinion in this, Jake? It&rsquo;s my choice, it&rsquo;s my body, it&rsquo;s my life.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">&ldquo;I would&rsquo;ve stayed by your side and helped you go through this.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you would. I seriously thought you weren&rsquo;t going to talk to me again, and I&rsquo;ve been alone for a long time and life became really hard.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>She paused to pour more wine.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about transitioning for years and I never got the courage to actually do it and one day things became so hard, I didn&rsquo;t know what else to do.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">I couldn&rsquo;t live like a woman anymore. I don&rsquo;t know. I honestly thought you&rsquo;d stay angry at me no matter what I did, so I decided to keep it away from you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">&ldquo;Of course not, Mom! I mean... Dad-&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">&ldquo;Ahahaha.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>She burst out laughing at his joke and it made him chuckle.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">&ldquo;Oh God, I missed you so much, Jake! Please don&rsquo;t ever leave me again.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Things became emotional pretty quickly. Jake told her he wasn&rsquo;t gonna leave her anytime soon, which he knew was true because he needed some time to get back on his feet again.</p>
<p>Six months ago, he was laid off, and since then he&rsquo;s been swimming in the sea of unemployment. He tried to make ends meet through various side hustles, but none bore fruit.</p>
<p>Now, he&rsquo;s teetering on the brink of broke, with no money to pay the rent. His girlfriend left him, and for the past month, he&rsquo;s been leeching off a friend who&rsquo;s now on the verge of kicking him out if he doesn&rsquo;t start chipping in for the bills.</p>
<p>A week ago, his uncle called. Jake confided in him about his troubles and his desperate quest for a job. His uncle sympathized, offered to help him find work, only after reprimanding him for not supporting his mother through her transition.</p>
<p>Jake was stunned to learn of his mom&rsquo;s transition. Their last conversation in January over the phone ended in a fight, and as his life plummeted shortly after, he wasn&rsquo;t eager to reach out to anyone beyond his immediate circle, which excluded family. He was ashamed of the mess he&rsquo;d become.</p>
<p>To discover that his mother had decided to transition and had intentionally kept this from him was a shock beyond belief. But here he is, sitting next to her, wondering if she truly has a cock between her legs.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">&ldquo;You know? When people tell you to grow balls, they don&rsquo;t usually mean it literally.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>She laughed again, her face and body flushed from the alcohol, though it wasn&rsquo;t truly a joke. During their last call, she had sheepishly and frustratingly complained about how hard life was. Unable to hold back, he snapped, <span class="GMD-Jake">&ldquo;Grow some fucking balls, Mom, and live with it!&rdquo;</span> He didn&rsquo;t mean it literally, of course, or in any sense.</p>
<p>Back then, Jake was as frustrated with his life as much as Bailey was with hers, and he took it out on her. Their phone call erupted into a fight, bringing up old grievances and airing long-held grudges.</p>
<p>When his uncle told him she had undergone the first surgery on January 27, the day after that call, Jake thought it was some kind of sick joke, but it wasn&rsquo;t truly a joke.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t because of you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">&ldquo;Then why did you do it?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>The room was silent, save for the occasional tick of the clock on the mantelpiece. Bailey glanced over at the empty armchair, once her husband&rsquo;s favorite spot, and felt a pang of guilt. The house felt hollow without his presence, yet she knew the emptiness had started long before he physically left.</p>
<p>For years, Bailey had felt the walls closing in around her, her husband James&rsquo; stern gaze and controlling demeanor stifling her every move.</p>
<p>He dictated what she wore, where she went, and who she spoke to. It was as if she lived in a cage, beautiful but suffocating.</p>
<p>The breaking point had come one night when she dared to voice her own dreams and aspirations. His harsh words still echoed in her mind, a reminder of why they had to part ways.</p>
<p><span style="color: #A8A196">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being selfish, Bailey. Think about our son,&rdquo;</span> he had said, his face masked with cold fury.</p>
<p>And think about their son, she did. Jake, their bright and sensitive teenager, who had once adored her. But her decision to break her family apart had shattered that bond.</p>
<p>The day his father packed his bags, Jake stood in the doorway, his eyes filled with betrayal.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">&ldquo;How could you, Dad? How could you just walk away?&rdquo;</span> he had shouted, his emotion cracking his voice.</p>
<p>His father had tried to explain, but his words fell on deaf ears, at least he thought back then, but they truly weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Bailey and James divorced. Bailey, who was far more successful than her ex-husband, won custody of Michael, while his father vanished, abandoning them without a backward glance or a word ever again.</p>
<p>Jake rained his mother with blame, words etched deep in his mind by his father&rsquo;s bitter narratives. His father&rsquo;s voice echoed in his mind, convincing him that Bailey had ruined the marriage, dismantling their family. He loved his mom truly and deeply. They were very close to each other. If you heard them talk, you&rsquo;d think they were friends, not mother and son. But his father was even closer to him, and he left after he couldn&rsquo;t fight with Bailey anymore.</p>
<p>Months passed. And then months turned into years. Bailey thought Jake had forgiven her, but soon after he graduated from college, he left her and chose to live alone, proving he still held that old grudge against her. The day Jake packed his bags, she stood in the doorway, her eyes filled with a woman&rsquo;s fury.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">BAILEY</span> <em>(voice trembling with anger)</em><br><span class="story-dialogue">I can&rsquo;t believe this, Jake. After everything I&rsquo;ve done for you, you&rsquo;re just going to walk out of here like I don&rsquo;t matter.</span></p>
<p>Jake sighed and tried to push his mother to the side gently by her shoulder. She wouldn&rsquo;t budge.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">JAKE</span><br><span class="story-dialogue">Mom, we&rsquo;ve talked about this. I need to find my own path. This isn&rsquo;t about you.</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">BAILEY</span> <em>(voice rising)</em><br><span class="story-dialogue">Not about me? I&rsquo;ve spent the last twenty-two years fighting your battles, paying for your welfare, your education. Do you have any idea how much I sacrificed for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">JAKE</span> <em>(frustrated, finally showing aggression)</em><br><span class="story-dialogue">I know, Mom. I appreciate everything you&rsquo;ve done, but I need to do this on my own. I can&rsquo;t stay here forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">BAILEY</span> <em>(sarcastic)</em><br><span class="story-dialogue">Oh, how noble of you. After leeching off me for years, now you suddenly want independence? Where was this drive when I was paying for your tuition, your rent, your food?</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">JAKE</span> <em>(angry)</em><br><span class="story-dialogue">That&rsquo;s not fair. You offered to help. You said you wanted me to have a good start in life. Now you&rsquo;re throwing it back in my face?</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">BAILEY</span> <em>(voice breaking)</em><br><span class="story-dialogue">Because I thought you&rsquo;d care, Jake. I thought you&rsquo;d be grateful, that you&rsquo;d stay and help me. But no, you&rsquo;re just like your father. You take and take, demand and demand and then leave when I start challenging you.</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">JAKE</span> <em>(hurt)</em><br><span class="story-dialogue">First of all, don&rsquo;t ever compare me to Dad. I&rsquo;m nothing like him. This isn&rsquo;t about taking advantage. I love you, but I can&rsquo;t stay here and be the person you want me to be. I need to figure out who I am without you hovering over me.</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">BAILEY</span> <em>(desperation creeping in)</em><br><span class="story-dialogue">Hovering? Is that what you call it? Caring for you, worrying about you, making sure you had everything you needed? That&rsquo;s hovering?</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">JAKE</span> <em>(softly)</em><br><span class="story-dialogue">No, Mom. That&rsquo;s love. But love can be smothering. I need space to grow.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">BAILEY</span> <em>(bitterly)</em><br><span class="story-dialogue">Fine. Go then. But don&rsquo;t come crawling back when you realize the world doesn&rsquo;t care about you like I do.</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">JAKE</span> <em>(firmly)</em><br><span class="story-dialogue">I won&rsquo;t.</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">BAILEY</span> <em>(tears welling up)</em><br><span class="story-dialogue">You ungrateful child! After everything I&rsquo;ve done, this is how you repay me? You leave me?</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">JAKE</span><br><span class="story-dialogue">I&rsquo;m not leaving you, Mom. I&rsquo;m just-</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">BAILEY</span> <em>(sobbing)</em><br><span class="story-dialogue">Get out. If you&rsquo;re so eager to leave, just go.</span></p>
<p>She stepped aside, turning her back to him. Jake hesitated, wanting to say more, but knowing it will only escalate the fight, he picked up his bag, looked at his mother, let out his usual discontented sigh and walked towards the door. Bailey stopped him again.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">&ldquo;No! You&rsquo;re not gonna leave me now! Give me that bag!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>She tried to snatch the bag from him but he held to it tightly. His free hand slapped her forearm viciously, grabbing it and yanking it back, bending her arm by the elbow in front of her. Bailey screamed. <span class="GMD-Jake">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you put your hand on me,&rdquo;</span> he growled menacingly in her face.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">&ldquo;Are you crazy? You&rsquo;re gonna hit your own mother?!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">&ldquo;No, but don&rsquo;t make me do it!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>She tried to wrestle herself free from his grip but he overpowered her and twisted her arm behind her.</p>
<p>Her second cry pierced his ears, genuinely frightening him; he released his mother at once. Pausing, he wondered if he had pushed it too far, only to see her sprint towards the kitchen. With a sudden, frantic motion, she grabbed a handful of dishes from the counter and hurled them through the air. He shielded his face with one arm, but none of the plates touched him. Instead, one by one, they shattered against the wall behind him and the floor beneath, their crashing drowned out by his mother&rsquo;s metallic screams.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">&ldquo;Leave! Leave! Leaaaave! You pathetic, spineless, useless motherfucker! Leave me just when I need you. You&rsquo;re my only man, god damn it. Leaaaaave! I don&rsquo;t need a man anymore. I&rsquo;ve carried you and your father before you, I&rsquo;m better off without youuuuu!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>When the plates were all broken, she swept the remaining kitchenware off the counter in a manic rage, sending them clattering to the floor. Exhausted from her tirade, she collapsed, burying her head between her knees and wailing over her miserable state.</p>
<p>Jake couldn&rsquo;t bear to witness his mother&rsquo;s mental meltdown a moment longer. He picked up his bag once more and stepped towards the door, muttering a simple but crushing blow as he went.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">&ldquo;Now I understand why Dad left.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Months passed, as they inevitably do.</p>
<p>Years passed too.</p>
<p>Every holiday, every birthday slipped by in painful silence. Bailey sent messages, left voicemails, and even wrote letters, but Jake rarely responded. He would ghost her for long periods, only to eventually succumb to her persistent outreach. When he did respond, it was always cordially and cheerfully, joking and trying to lift his miserably cranky mother&rsquo;s spirits, but always cautiously and briefly, steering clear of her notorious mood swings. He knew his mother was emotionally unstable and craved opportunities to unleash her emotions, but he couldn&rsquo;t bear her emotional baggage on his shoulders.</p>
<p>He would have avoided her entirely if he could, but he loved her too much, and he enjoyed their conversations when she was in a good mood. After a string of pleasant phone calls during last Christmas, he opened up to her. He shared his dissatisfactions and worries about his relationship, his problems at work, and how heavy life was beginning to feel. She, in turn, opened up to him, but while he spoke for twenty minutes, she lectured him for two hours. She compared his trivial troubles to her own, dictating how he should act&mdash;find a better girl, get a better job, learn to overcome his feelings.</p>
<p>He listened as she pressed him down and emasculated him, not daring to hang up on her as she held this mental grip over him. Finally, he broke out in frustration, and they had their last fight.</p>

<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">&ldquo;I was already seeing a therapist for a number of years now and she was supporting me in the idea, pushing me for it even. And then one day, I just did it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">&ldquo;Are things going well?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">&ldquo;Yeah. Of course... Better than ever.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">&ldquo;Really? You don&rsquo;t seem so sure about it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s tougher than you think.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">&ldquo;You look great by the way.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">&ldquo;Really? Do I look any different?&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look like someone who&rsquo;s transitioning at all to be honest. I swear you look younger and hotter than ever.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">&ldquo;Ahahaha. Yeah, that&rsquo;s one of the benefits. It&rsquo;s the testosterone and growth hormone injections. It makes my skin more elastic and firmer, and... what&rsquo;s the word, uhh, hydration, the hormones help with water retention so my skin looks more supple. I think overall, it does make me look slightly younger.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">The testosterone makes my skin oily though. And ughh the acne, oh God, I&rsquo;m lucky I don&rsquo;t have any on my face right now, but my back is so full of them.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">&ldquo;Mmhm.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">&ldquo;It makes me feel so much better too. Suddenly I&rsquo;m more confident and energetic than ever. I feel like I only started living recently. Honestly, best decision of my life.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; </span></p>
<p>Bailey nodded, then poured herself another glass. Jake noticed she looked a bit attached.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">&ldquo;Tell me more about it. How did it all go through.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p>Bailey took a moment to collect herself then spilled all the details about her ${appendLinkInline('transition.', 'section4')}</p>

<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Wow. You transitioned in six months?"</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Yeah. I was supposed to have fully transitioned a month ago or something but I'm having troubles still."</span></p>
<p>Jake saw Bailey come undone faster than a button on a too-tight shirt. Months? This mess should&rsquo;ve taken years. But in an age where you can get your eyes zapped and see clearer than your future in five damn minutes, this wasn't that impressive. Progress, they call it. Jake, though, couldn&rsquo;t wrap his booze-soaked brain around any of it.</p>
<p>There he was, sprawled in his armchair, head lolled back, mouth open like a dead fish. His face was slack and expressionless, and it occasionally twitched as he let out an incoherent mumble Bailey could somehow interpret.</p>
<p>His unbuttoned shirt was stained with droplets of wine he spilled over himself, and his tousled hair clung to his forehead, damp with sweat. His legs were splayed out haphazardly, with one foot still wearing a shoe while the other had lost its counterpart somewhere in the room. Both feet revealed mismatching socks. One of his arms hung over the side of the chair, clutching an empty bottle, while the other draped lifelessly over his crotch. You could see Jake from a mile away and know he was totally drunk, you'd had to get up close to know how really miserable he was.</p>
<p>Bewildering, what technology had done to humanity. Convenience had killed the need for hard work. Who needed graphic designers in a world where machines did everything?</p>
<p>Jake was a relic, a throwback to when artists people still mattered.</p>
<p>On the couch to his side lay Bailey. Her arm dangled off the edge, fingers grazing the floor. Her eyes, half-open, glazed over, stared at the floor, as if it held the secret to soften life's hardships.</p>
<p>Her dress was crumpled and ridden up her lap, revealing her smooth white meaty thighs to him and half her right buttock. She was lying on her stomach with her legs closed, so Jake couldn't catch a peek of her penis or testicles, though he squinted and watched her careully for a few seconds trying to convince himself there was a bulge under his mother's legs.</p>
<p>Her skin shone in the fading sunlight. Jake&rsquo;s eyes roamed her body with no shame, no shyness. The woman on the couch didn&rsquo;t match his memory of his mother. Not only did she lose a ton of weight, she looked fresh, almost radiant. Her attitude had softened too, became more inviting.</p>
<p>In her late forties, Bailey looked more beautiful than he could ever remember. Luscious lips, alluring skin, DDD cups (Where did those come from? Or did he just notice them?), flat stomach, killer legs. When he squinted his eyes, for a second there, his mother looked hotter than his ex for fuck's sake. Growing a dick? You gotta be fucking kidding.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"So, your next appointment is tomorrow?"</span> Jake asked, standing up with a grunt and settling on the edge of the couch next to his mother. He grabbed her bottle from the floor and poured two glasses. Bailey sat up, folding her legs under her to give him more room. She took the bottle, swigging from it directly before answering.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Mmhm. I really hope it goes well. Wanna come along? <em>(Burp)</em> Excuse me."</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Oh, oh, the hormones are kicking in,"</span> he joked.</p>
<p>Bailey didn't react. She seemed too anxious, her mind stuck on the appointment. Her sisters had been with her since the beginning, but lately, their support was just voices on the phone.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"I'll see if I have time. Hey, are you supposed to drink the day before your check-up?"</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"No, I'm not supposed to drink at all! But&mdash;"</span> She took another sip. <span class="GMD-Bailey">"Don't tell her I did, ehehehe."</span></p>
<p>Bailey playfully covered Jake's mouth. He chuckled, and when she didn't move her hand, he kissed her palm, signaling it was enough. They were both very drunk.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"I think she's gonna know anyway,"</span> he said, reaching for the bottle in Bailey's hand and realizing it was empty. He burst out laughing.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Haha. What happened?"</span> Bailey asked.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Oh my god. I still can't get my head around this. Ahahaha. You wanna tell me that you wanted to grow balls and you ended up growing your tits? Ahahaha."</span></p>
<p>Jake laughed hysterically, collapsing back onto the couch.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Oh, for fuck's sake, Jake! Don't make fun of me!"</span></p>
<p>Bailey craved another sip but was disappointed to find the bottle dry.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"This is the most miserable shit ever,"</span> Jake howled, his face almost blue at this point.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Ahahaha,"</span> Bailey joined in, throwing herself back, and lying down like Jake. They laughed like maniacs, draining the last drops of their energy and breath.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"I missed you so much, Jake."</span></p>
<p>Jake sat up, rolled over, and leaned above her, his elbow propped next to her head on the couch. He looked deeply into his mother's eyes.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"I don&rsquo;t believe you."</span></p>
<p>"You don't believe that I missed you?"</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"I wanna see it."</span></p>
<p>He pinched her inner thigh playfully, right next to her crotch. Bailey gasped and tried to sit up, but Jake pinned her down with two fingers against her chest.</p>
<p>Jake's eyes were serious, almost predatory.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"You wanna see it?"</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Yes."</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"What? Why?"</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"I wanna be part of this journey. I owe you a lot and I regret leaving you five years ago when you needed me most. Now you need someone by your side more than ever. Don't you?"</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"I do but... Why do you wanna see it?"</span></p>
<p>Jake shrugged.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"I just wanna see it. You know? Men don't usually shy off showing their penises to other men, unless it's a very small one."</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Yeah, it's very small actually. So I think we shouldn't do this."</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"I still wanna see it."</span></p>
<p>Jake slipped his hands between Bailey's thighs. She immediately closed her legs, trapping Jake's hand between them.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Jake!"</span></p>
<p>Her eyes widened in disbelief, shock painted across her face.</p>
<p>Jake stopped but didn&rsquo;t pull his hand away from between his mother's thighs. He stared into hereyes coldly for a moment, then dropped his gaze to her jugs.</p>

</figure>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Aw. Look what you've done!"</span></p>
<p>Bailey immediately pulled Jake's arm out from between her legs and her hands raced to cover her nipples. Her boobs had slipped out from under her dress during the commotion. Her tone was scolding but she covered herself in a rather provocative way.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"I don't care about your boobs. Show me those nuts."</span></p>

<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Stop it, Jake. This is a really bad joke."</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Look, Mom. This might be the alcohol speaking, but I'm gonna see your cock right now no matter what. So, just flash it real quick or else I'll make you do it."</span></p>
<p>Jake tried to force her legs open.</p>

    <img src="${baseImagesFolder}/7.jpg" data-animate-block>

</figure>
<p>Bailey suddenly screamed out of pain. Jake imagined she squeezed her balls between her legs and the thought increased his urge to actually see what's between her legs.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"<em>(angrily)</em> It's just a quick look. What are you scared of?"</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Wait! It's just... ok, I'll show you, but give me a minute to collect myself, because I'm seriously panicking right now!"</span></p>
<p>She was visibly panicking. She sweated profusely and her eyes moved in all directions frantically.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Ok, relax, I'm not gonna push you..."</span></p>
<p>Relief is starting to show on Bailey's face.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"... as long as you show it to me,"</span> Jake continued.</p>
<figure style="max-width: 300px; margin-right:auto; margin-left:auto">

<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Ehehehe. Oh my God, you're so stubborn. Alright, I'll show it to you... Can you give me a minute, I'll go to the bathroom first."</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Why?"</span></p>
<figure style="max-width: 300px; margin-right:auto; margin-left:auto">
    <img src="${baseImagesFolder}/9.jpg" data-animate-block>

</figure>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"I need to go to the bathroom real quick. I'll show it to you after I come out. I promise."</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"That's very suspicious."</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Suspicious? Like what am I going to do in a minute in the bathroom? Look, I'm... I've... never shown it to anybody, other than my doctor, and I'm terribly embarrassed about it."</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Why are you embarrassed about it?"</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"It doesn't look like what I imagined it would be. It's actually ugly."</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Your cock is ugly? What the hell does it matter for?"</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"I don't know, Jake. Just give me a minute for myself. Wait for me in my bedroom. I'll wash it and come show it to you, ok?"</span></p>
<p>Jake's eyes narrowed in suspicion of the whole setup and even though he didn't understand why she needed to go to the bathroom, he was in no mood to fight, so he reluctantly agreed and decided to let it be. Bailey straightened up, adjusted her dress, covering her boobs, and then stood up, pulling her dress down, making sure her butt was covered up as she stood up in front of Jake. She then suddenly dashed towards the bathroom, giggling along the way and before she got to the bathroom, she turned around, looking over her shoulder at Jake who had his eyes fixed on her hips, trying to get a faint glimpse of her balls.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Jake, we're very drunk. Go to sleep,"</span> she said from the other side of the room.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Mom, if you lock that door, I'll break it."</span></p>
<p>Bailey entered the bathroom and locked the door behind her.</p>

<p>The faucet squeaked and Bailey dipped her head into the sink, letting the cold water drench her hair. Two minutes of icy clarity later, she rose and faced her reflection. Red eyes stared back,<span class="GMD-Bailey">"We are soooo very drunk right now, Jake,"</span> she slurred to herself. Her hand slid down, caressing the faint bruise on her thigh, right where Jake's fingers had dug in, trying to pry her open. Why did he want to see her cock so badly?</p>
<p>She took her dress and underwear off and stood naked in front of the mirror, gazing at her her newly earned penis and testicles.</p>
<p>That freaky tiny faulty cock they gave her. So many nights she'd cried herself to sleep, questioning her decision to transition, cursing herself for being neither here nor there, neither woman nor man. How could she have traded her womanhood for this ugly thing? She'd begged the doctor to undo it, to turn her back, but they told her she had to wait. Two more months at least before any more invasive surgeries. The doctor insisted on patience and suggested they keep pushing for better results. But Bailey knew better. She was a hopeless case.</p>
<p>And then Jake showed up.</p>
<p>She massaged her thigh and crotch, at the parts where Jake touched her. Se didn't get that same feeling she had a few minutes ago. When Jake pinched her thigh, she was excited. A feeling of warmth grew between her legs. It was the same feeling she had when her clit got stiff when she played with herself or had sex before the transition. It was the first time she had a sexual feeling in her crotch since the phalloplasty operation. She was completely embarrassed by having her child touch her so intimately, oh yes, it was intimate, the lust in his eyes was palpable. Her mind burned with alarms of the inappropriateness of the situation but the warmth in her crotch increased as Jake insisted he sees her cock, that warm feeling between her legs was replaced by fullness and pressure, which is what her doctor described a boner would feel like, and while she was ecstatic to see Jake again after 5 years of absence, she was beyond thrilled to have finally felt sexual feelings after months of despair. Bailey opened her bathroom cabinet and pulled a lipstick case out.</p>
<p>Staring at her red, watery eyes in the mirror, with her head heavy and her hair soaked wet, she whispered to herself.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"We are soooo... very... drunk... right now."</span></p>

<p>The door to Bailey's room opened with a creak. Jake was there, perched on the edge of Bailey's bed, his head in his hands, looking completely drunk and dizzy. Jake raised his head slowly. He might've not heard the door open but he smelled his mother's familiar lavender soap as she walked into the room. She smelt fresh and clean. Wearing only a chemise with a towel wrapped around her waist, her face washed and clear of makeup, except for her lips being smeared with pink lipstick, she closed the door behind her and walked over to Jake at the edge of her bed. Shyly, she stood in front of him, and asked</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Do you wanna see it?"</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Drop the towel,"</span> he responded, impatiently.</p>
<p>Bailey dropped the towel, revealing her completely naked lower half to him. Jake examined the abomination in front of him for a couple of seconds, no words esacaping his mouth or a meaningful expression popping up on his face. Bailey's knees shook slighlty. She looked closely at his face, eager to find out what he thinks of it and what he thinks of her now, frankly anxious that he'll make fun of her. 10 seconds of complete silence from Jake and absolute anticipation from Bailey passed, until finally Jake lifted his eyes to his mother's.</p>

<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"I mean, look at it. What is this?"</span> He reached out, pinching it between his index finger and thumb, like he was plucking lint off his shirt.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"How much did you pay for this?"</span> he said, his voice dripping with derision. He gave it a little tug, like he expected it to fall apart in his hand.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"It doesn't really matter."</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"You've been scammed. No, you've been robbed. They stole your vagina and gave you... cock skin I guess. What is this?"</span> Jake asked aggressively, his face full of disgust. Bailey pulled away, turned around, and put her face in her palms.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Oh my God, you're right. What have I done?"</span></p>
<p>Jake stood up, approached his mother and hugged her from behind.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Can they turn you back?"</span></p>
<p>Bailey tilted her head back, resting it on Jake's shoulder. <span class="GMD-Bailey">"Not before a long time passes,"</span> She murmurred.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"The doctor said I shouldn't try to turn back. She did a great job, she said, and she believes the results are fantastic. But... the problem is with me myself."</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"What does that mean?"</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"It's not supposed to look like this. They planted generative cells inside the cock that are supposed to grow with time but my mind refuses to accept it, so it doesn't grow. I don't even recieve any feelings from it. Like it's attached to my body with artificial glue and it's just dangling there."</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"So it will grow when you're aroused?"</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Sure. But I meant it will grow in general with time, like boys as they grow up, but it's supposed to be much faster."</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"I see. That explains why there's so much skin around it. It's going to fill and take its real shape it as it grows."</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Yes. That's exactly it." Bailey answered with a sigh of relief, seemingly comforted by Jake's understanding.</span></p>
<p>Jake lowered his hand and grabbed her penis again. It was very small. The whole thing was two thirds as long as a finger but half of thay was just extra skin that was falling off the penis. He had to pinch it the very base to feel the meat inside, which was as long as the tip of his index finger. He tried to stroke it but couldn't manage to hold a grip. His hand fell to feel Bailey's testicles instead.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"They did a good job with the balls, I must say."</span></p>
<p>Bailey gave little reaction to him playing with her balls. As if she didn't really feel anything from them. Jake cupped her ball in his palm, squeezed them, and tugged them below. They were firm and full but quite small. Jake pulled the scrotum down a a couple of times, asking Bailey if she felt anything.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"It's very faint."</span></p>

<p>Jake turned Bailey around to face him, keeping his hand around her waist.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"So what are you gonna do next?"</span> He asked, sounding very considerate.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"The doctor said medication wouldn't lead to much more progress, it's all mental. She suggested I try and get myself aroused. I feel aroused sometimes, most of the times actually but it's all like nothing down there. Touch myself and start dating. Playing with myself doesn't work at all, I don't feel anything below my crotch, and... I' can't date anyone.'</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Why not?"</span> Jakes asked, tightening his grip around her waist, squeezing her body into his, particularly her tits. His mother didn't seem to alarmed about it at all. She was busy confiding in him.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"I don't know. The concept of dating women somehow still turns me off. And, I don't know where I'd find a man who wants someone like this."</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Too bad there's a man right here."</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Not the kind of man I'm looking for, Jake."</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Why not?"</span></p>
<p>Jake slid his hand down his mother's back and groped her right buttcheek powerfully. She gasped and pushed him away, stepping back from him.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Jake, what the hell are you doing?"</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"I.. I'm sorry.. I don't know what happened to me. I lost myself for a second there."</span></p>
<p>Jake immediately lunged forward, reaching out forward to grab his mom's chemise before she got any further from him.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Do you know how fucking hot you are right now?"</span> He growled as he wrapped one arm tightly around her waist, grabbing her arm hand by the other, bending it behind her back. Bailey tried to fight and push him off but he overpowered her and forcefully carried her to bed. She squirmed and shook so much he lost his balance and fell on his back on the bed.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Jake, stop! Ahhhh!"</span> Bailey screamed when Jake suddenly slapped her butt quite harshly.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Stay still,"</span> He demanded, bending her right arm even further behind her back.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Are you crazy? Leave me now."</span> She screamed again after Jake slapped her left buttcheek a second time, and then again when he struck her in the middle of her butt, slamming her buttcrack with his palm, immediately following with a hard slap to her right buttcheek.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Shut up and stay still,"</span> Jake demanded, gritting his teeth. Bailey was astonished by his sudden anger and violence towards her.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Are you fucking hard right now, motherfucker?"</span> She screamed in his face at the top of her lungs when she felt the hard bulge in his pants sticking against her crotch as she lay on top of him. He responded by striking her butt again with all his might and bending her right arm even harder, and as Bailey fought his slaps followed in rapid succession; left buttcheek, right buttcheek, her lower back, her underbuttocks, and her thighs, nonstop. Bailey would soon after learn to stop fighting him and shut up as he demanded, her moans faltering and fading to silent quivers. Only then, Jake's violence began to subside.</p>
<p>He stopped hitting his mother when he realized she wasn't resisting him any longer. He stared back at her spiteful eyes above him and he flinched when her tears fell on his face.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Why are you doing this?"</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"You said you were aroused all the time. And I'm horny as fuck right now."</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Go fuck a whore, or fuck yourself, you ungrateful child,"</span> Bailey muttered, spitting on Jake's face below her in disgust. <span class="GMD-Bailey">"You're not gonna take advantage of your mother in her lowest state, you freak."</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Fine. I'll fuck the nearest whore."</span></p>
<p>Jake immediately sat up and clasped a fistful of his mother's hair near the roots. With his firm hold, he motioned her until he had her on his lap. He unleashed another powerful smack on her ass, before separating her buttcheeks with his thumb and index finger. He stared at his mother's clean pink asshole for a second and when she shook her hips in protest, he tensed his grasp of her hair and she groaned in pain.</p>
<p>Then he scooped Bailey's spit off his face and ran his spit-soaked finger through her asscrack, stroking the area around her anus with the pad of his middle finger.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"No, Jake, no no no,"</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Shhhhh,"</span> Jake shushed his mother, tugging her hair back roughly. Taking long breaths through his clenched teeth, he hissed, as he took a moment to caress her smooth ass and thighs briefly but sensually, before returning to her asshole again. He slowly pushed his middle finger inside her ass, to the first knuckle. Bailey gasped.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Fuck,"</span> He exclaimed, releasing his grasp of Bailey's hair and pushing her head forward. Bailey was finally free from his stronghold, but didn't try to get away from him. She lay still on his lap as he hissed lustily while massaging the inner walls of her asshole back and forth.</p>
<p>For the first time since she got it, Bailey felt something in her penis. A hot feeling, gradually increasing in intensity, rose from the base of her penis, inside her body.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Fuck, this is good,"</span> Jake repeated as he took his finger out, spread Bailey's asscheeks wide, and lowered his head to spit on her tight asshole. Then quickly returned his middle finger to her asshole and shoved it back in and worked his way till he got the second knuckle in.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Are you liking it?"</span> He asked while gently massaging her asshole from the inside, working his way deeper into her asshole as it stretched for him.</p>
<p>Bailey didn't answer. Embarrassed and disgusted to be dominated like this by her son, she couldn't speak to him.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Tell me. Are you feeling it?"</span> He insisted on an answer. His question coincided with his finger reaching the rounded lump at the back end of Bailey's penis. He tapped it with his finger twice.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Oh, yes, now, I'm feeling it! Oh... oh,"</span> Bailey hummed and moaned excitedly as Jake rubbed her prostate gently in circles.</p>
<p>A surge of heat went through Bailey's body. She felt it in her stomach, lower back, shoulder, neck and head. She was uncomfortable with her ass being fingered, and she didn't know if she enjoyed it or not. It wasn't comparable to having her pussy fingered before by a mile, it was far less sensitive than her vagina used to be. It wasn't the same feeling of having something in her ass before either. But she sure as hell there was some pleasure in it. And while she was completely against being fingered by her son, she found herself arching back eager for more of this new feeling.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Do you like it?"</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"I don't know. It feels strange, but I'm definitely feeling something."</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"What about now?"</span></p>
<p>Jake started fingering her asshole. He slid his finger back and forth, bending at the knuckle to stroke Bailey's prostate when he reached it. As her moans got more pronounced, he increased the speed and power of his thrusts, and so Bailey's moans and gasps got softer and sultier.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Jake, please, Jake, take it easy, it's starting to hurt,"</span> She pleaded he got easier on her.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Oh you really like it, don't you?"</span></p>
<p>Jake inserted his finger as far as he could, drilling and corkscrewing at the end, in an attempt to push his finger far inside his mom's asshole as possible.</p>
<p>At his mother's spasming he bent his finger and tickled her prostate twice, pausing to tease her. When he saw her wiggling her butt over his lap, trying to get his finger to stroke her prostate again, he tickled it three times quickly and paused again.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"No no Jake, please!"</span></p>
<p>To her surprise, Jake actually took his finger out and before she could turn her head and look at why he actually stopped, Jake shoved two fingers inside her ass.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Ah Ah Ah."</span></p>
<p>He fingered her rapidly. It began to feel really uncomfortable.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"No, no, Jake, Jake!"</span></p>
<p>He shushed her again, fingering her even more powerfully and lowering his head to her ear.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Don't fight it, Mom. Let go completely. Cum... Cum for me."</span></p>
<p>He spoke in such a low intimate tone, it excited Bailey a lot. But he had barely finished his sentence and he had bit Bailey's earlobe, pulling her face towards him while he fingered her. Bailey was ecstatic.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Ahhhh! Ah Ah Ah Ah Ahhhhh!"</span></p>
<p>Bailey suddenly pulled herself away, Jake's teeth grazing against her earlobe as she got off his lap and stood up at the edge of the bed. A massive surge of heat circulating in her stomach and her crotch was so hot at this point, she knew she was on the edge of orgasm. And for the first time ever she felt her little cock tense up and she stood there to make sense of all those feelings going inside her until that heat dropped and collected at the base of her spine, flowing down through her testicles, then rising through her tiny penis. For a moment there she gazed at her penis anticipating the moment of orgasm. Her sensations heightened and built to a climax point at the base of her penis and then a full-body orgasm was released, and as Bailey shook and shivered to the orgasm, a thin stream of milky fluid leaked from her penis.</p>

<p>She stood a full minute silent in awe of what she'd just experienced</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Oh, my God! Jake! Jake, I did it."</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"We did it,"</span> He corrected her. Bailey quickly jumped on the bed, landing on top of him.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Oh my God, you made me cum. Jake, it felt so good, it felt so good,"</span> she exclaimed happily as she rained his face with kisses.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Sorry if I was a little rough on you,</span>" His apology sounded sincere.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Are you kidding me? I thought you were gonna rape me?"</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"I had a feeling you'd like that."</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"<em>(gasp)</em> Are you insane?"</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"It doesn't matter. What matters is that you liked it."</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Oh, yes, I did. Oh, Jake, I've been so desperate for months. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."</span> She kissed his face three times more, with the last one ending on his lips.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"I've been so lost and I was hopeless... Do you think I could do it? Should I keep going with the transition?"</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"If you're going to stay like this, I know I won't mind it," Jake said as he groped her tits.</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Jake, no!"</span> Bailey pulled herself away from him.</p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Mom, I just made you cum. It's only fair if you return the favor."</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"No, Jake, this is so wrong, we can't do this again."</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"I see. Post-nut clarity it is."</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"What? No, Jake, I'm your mother, I'm not gonna have sex with you!"</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Jake">"Mom! Do you know how ridiculous you sound right now?! You're literally turning yourself into a man. That's 10 times more wrong than incest in my book!"</span></p>
<p><span class="GMD-Bailey">"Shut up, Jake. You're drunk! Get Out. I can't stand looking at you,"</span> Bailey shouted, pointing at her bedroom door.</p>
<p>Jake tried to rise, but his limbs were heavy, drained of all energy. He managed to prop himself up on his elbows, his eyes bloodshot and glassy. <span class="GMD-Jake">&ldquo;Where the hell am I supposed to go? I don&rsquo;t have a place to stay.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>He dropped back onto the mattress, sinking into it again.</p>
<p>Bailey glared at him, stunned. She hadn't meant to kick him out, the idea of him leaving again scared her. Her anger softened into something like an apology. <span class="GMD-Bailey">&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll sleep on the couch then.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>She turned, intending to make her way to the door, but her foot caught on a stray shoe, and she stumbled. Her momentum carried her back towards the bed. Instead of opening the door and leaving, she ended up tripping and landed heavily on the mattress beside Jake.</p>
<p>She lay there for a moment, staring at the ceiling, her breath coming in uneven bursts. She turned to see if Jake saw her comical fall but he was so worn out he'd fallen to sleep already. She wanted to get up but she too was worn out and depleted. She closed her eyes, surrendering to the exhaustion, and spent the night next to him on bed.</p>
