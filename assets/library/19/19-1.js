        <p><strong>--Ah! Ah! Mmmmhmm.</strong></p>
<p>The sound of a fork thudding against a plate.</p>
<p><strong>--Come on baby, my turn now.</strong></p>
<p>She goes on her knees, ducking under the table. He takes his belt off, throws it away. She unzips his pants, takes his cock out.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Jaime">Jaime:</span> So how was your day?</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew:</span> Usual.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Jaime">Jaime:</span> Like...</p>
<p><em>(glub glub glub)</em></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Jaime">Jaime:</span> <em>(deep breath, sighs)</em> What did you do today?</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew:</span> Met this new boy- <em>(drops his fork suddenly, puts his face in his palm)</em></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Jaime">Jaime:</span> Oh, come on, Dad! We said don't take it out on the table!</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Dean">Dean:</span> Shut up, Jaime! Stay busy, slut! Come on, take it in, all in, there you go!</p>
<p>Dad, standing, Mom's hair wrapped around his fist, yanks her head back, relieving his cock from the pressure of her mouth. Mom's mouth is open agape. Drool is falling off the corners of her mouth, sliding down her chin. She's dying for air. Mom always looks disgusting after a gag.Drew takes his head off his palm. He eyes the disgusting pigs in front of him with the most dreadful look on his face. Jaime strokes his thigh gently, soothing him.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Jaime">Jaime:</span> So you made friends today finally?</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew:</span> Nah, it's just a- <em>(Glk glk glk in the background)...</em> this fucking slut, Jaime.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Vanessa">Vanessa:</span> Grrg Grrg Mmph Whee.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Jaime">Jaime:</span> I know. Just finish your food.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Dean">Dean:</span> You want more? Huh?</p>
<p>The fucking slut doesn't respond. She claws Dad's naked butt and pulls his torso towards her, placing her closed lips on his shaft. Dad in turn grabs her head from behind her ears, poking those lips open with a slow deliberate thrust into his slut's mouth. She sucks his cock into her mouth like a spaghetti noodle, or a large banana if you ever saw someone trying to swallow a banana intact. She swallows Dad's cock into her mouth so smoothly, so perfectly, into her throat. It was their most impressive move. Everything else they did was batshit disgusting. Mom and Dad having sex on dinner, if you can call that sex, was nothing new. Watching them enter the bathroom and leave the door open wasn't either. If you saw Mom and Dad in the house, 6 times out of ten, one of them was on their knees sucking the other's sex parts in the most degrading way possible. 3 times out of 10, you'd cringe at the sight of Mom's ass railed violently or stretched agape to let the pain and cum out. There was a 10% chance you'd stumble into them acting like humans, having vaginal sex.</p>
<p>Slap!</p>
<p>Mom was choking on Dad's cock for half a minute. He had pinched her nose, depraving her of breath, until he released her with a monstrous slap to her forehead. She's gasping for air. Head tilted back due to another strike to the forehead. Her back arches when he pulls her hair back and down. He spits in her mouth. She struggles to swallow it. Dad spits in her eye, then draws nearer to lick it off. The fucking slut angrily slaps Dad's balls. He lets out a scary moan. Mom clasps his cock around the shaft and strokes it 3 times swiftly, immediately releasing it. Dad arches back, letting out a not-so-scary moan this time, his cock throbbing, precum leaking. He's been edging for a while, that's why he stood and didn't keep his cock under the table as he promised before dinner. He needs to change positions or he'll cum. Mom slaps his balls again. Really fucking hard. Then pulls Dad by his balls, puts both of them in her mouth in one gobble, and does whatever the fuck she does to them with her teeth, tongue, and the inside of her cheeks. Dad slams his leg on the table, spreading himself for Mom to suck on his balls.</p>
${storyVideo(1)}
<p>Drew didn't like calling his mom a fucking slut at first. But hearing Dad call her that so many times had imprinted it on him.</p>
<p>He's trying to ignore them. Jaime and Drew made a deal with Mom and Dad not to have sex on dinner--at least hide themselves while they did it, but there you go, not one day had passed on their promise and they broke it. Jaime rubs his inner thigh again, gesturing she understands his pain.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew:</span> It's not a big deal. There was this guy slash girl at sch-</p>
<p>(Phfft-Bllrrt)</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Vanessa">Vanessa:</span> Ahahaha! Excuse me!</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Dean">Dean:</span> Woah-ho-ho-ho. Good girl!</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew:</span> This a fucking disgrace!</p>
<p>When Dad lifted Mom onto the table and she farted as he shoved his cock inside her ass, that was Drew's breaking point. Drew slammed his hand on the table, got up and stormed to his bedroom. Jaime protested.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Jaime">Jaime:</span> Dad! Mom! That's fucking awful! Please stop. That's enough!</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Dean">Dean:</span> Shut up, Jaime.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Jaime">Jaime:</span> Shut up or what? You need to stop this, you're hurting us!</p>
<p>The same fucking dialogue every day.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Vanessa">Vanessa:</span> Ah! Ah! Deeper, Dean, go deeper!</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Jaime">Jaime:</span> Dad we said no fucking cock on the table!</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Dean">Dean:</span> I'm not in the <em>(thrust)</em> best mind now, Jemz. <em>(thrust)</em> Put <em>(thrust)</em> yourself in my <em>(thrust)</em> place.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Jaime">Jaime:</span> YOU PUT YOURSELVES IN OUR PLACES!</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Dean">Dean:</span> And do what exactly? <em>(thrust thrust thrust)</em></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Jaime">Jaime:</span> How would you feel if I...started...fucking...masturbating everywhere, huh? I'll go grab a dildo right now! Tell me how that makes you feel.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Dean">Dean:</span> That-</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Vanessa">Vanessa:</span> Don't pay her attention, Dean! Fuck me! Fuck me, harder!</p>
<p>He fucks the slut harder.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Jaime">Jaime:</span> Oh you don't mind? What if I start walking naked around the house too? Maybe I will. Maybe I will. Ughhhh. Stooooop!</p>
<p>She could walk off like Drew but she doesn't. Jaime whines as she watches Mom and Dad fuck on the table while eating as slowly as she can.</p>

<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian:</span> Can I ask you a favor?</p>
<p>His voice carries a delicate lilt, with gentle inflections vibrating through the whispering breeze. It's soft, his voice, almost ethereal, with a sweetness that evokes the memory of the delicate timbre of a songbird. His face is like a songbird's too.</p>
<p>A favor?</p>
<p>His nose is slender and refined, resembling the elegant beak. His eyes shimmer with the same brightness of a small bird's. Framing his face, his lips possess a softness that mirrors the tender chirps of a bird's call, forming a smile that's as enchanting as a bird's melody. Each word seems to flutter from his lips, imbued with a tender grace that caresses the ears. There's a lightness to his tone. His voice resonates with warmth and sensitivity that are unfamiliarly nice.</p>
<p>His face is beautiful but it was the voice...</p>
<p>The fragility and beauty with every sound uttered...</p>
<p>Is this a boy or a girl? Drew asked himself.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew:</span> <em>(aggressively)</em> What did you say?!</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian:</span> Those boys over there...</p>
<p>Damian points at the players in the middle of the field. Drew's eyes refuse to follow.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian:</span> Oh, forget about them. Can I walk with you?</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew:</span> Why?</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian:</span> They're gonna beat me.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew:</span> I asked why.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian:</span> Because they <em>(shrugs)</em>...because they can.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew:</span> <em>(shouting, cuffing the boy's ears)</em> Man up, slut! I'm not gonna stand up for you!</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian:</span> Ah!</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew:</span> Ah?!!</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian:</span> What did you do that for?</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew:</span> <em>(closing in)</em> Are you a boy or a girl?</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian:</span> <em>(steps back)</em> I'm a boy!</p>
<p>Drew grabs Damian's shirt, pulls him close and down, and slaps the back of Damian's head three times. Damian whimpers, trying to protect the back of his head with both arms.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew:</span> No, you're not! You're a slut!</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian:</span> No, I'm a boy. <em>(voice trembling, cracked)</em> I'm a boy!</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew:</span> No you're not, you're a fucking slut, aren't you? Say it!</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian:</span> No!</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew:</span> Say it, slut! Say it! Say it!</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian:</span> <em>(sobbing)</em> I'm not a slut. I didn't do anything.</p>
<p>Drew walks off, leaving Damian on the ground. Takes a few steps and finds Damian walking next to him again, with his backpack raised above his head.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew:</span> You want another beating.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian:</span> I'll just walk in your shadow.</p>
<p>Drew was taken aback by Damian's meekness toward him even after he beat him. Just moments ago, the boy was almost crying. But now, there's a brightness on his face.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew:</span> Suit yourself.</p>

<p>Drew and Damian passed the football ground to reach the desolate spot at the end. A series of elevated aluminum benches in an area barely anyone passes by anymore. There was a graffiti on the wall behind them. Written in an underground artistic style, "Drew's Spot". Drew sat, stared at the distance. Damian took a bag of sandwiches out. He was sitting a small distance away from Drew, or else he'd get another slutslapping as Drew threatened.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian:</span> <em>(mouth full)</em> What sandwiches do you have?</p>
<p>Damian asked, knowing clearly Drew didn't bring lunch with him. Didn't even hold a backpack.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian:</span> We should swap. I got PB&amp;J, whatcha got?</p>
<p>Damian took another bite and shook the sandwich in the air temptingly. Drew didn't answer. Damian jumped off the bench to the spot right in front of Drew. Gleefully exclaimed.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian:</span> Did you say Turkey and Cheese?! <em>(gasp)</em> That's so yummy! Mmmm.</p>
<p>Damian lifted his shirt up and stroked his white smooth puffy tummy in circles, with his tongue out sticking to the side cartoonishly. Drew cringed. Damian rolled his eyes.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian:</span> Why are you always silent? You never speak to anybody.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew:</span> There are few worthy to speak to.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian:</span> <em>(slams himself on the bench next to Drew)</em> You're always bored too. You're like the most secretive person in this school. I always wondered if you were a criminal. Are you? You have to be.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew:</span> Why do you speak in superlatives?</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian:</span> What?</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew:</span> Always. Never. Most. Some things are just...regular, you know? Why are you so interested in me?</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian:</span> I don't know. I guess it's what I do. I observe people. And I sometimes make stories about them.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew:</span> Do you observe most people?</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian:</span> Haha, funny guy! <em>(wobbling his head excitedly)</em> You should go back to being silent!</p>
<p>Drew chuckled. A ball slammed into the bench right next to Damian. If Damian hadn't dodged and taken cover behind Drew's back, that ball would've hit him in the face.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a shadow fell across the two, blocking the sunlight. Looking up, they found themselves face to face with Dan, towering over them with a sneer.</p>
<p><strong>"Hey, you there! Shake off your lazy ass and grab that ball for me,"</strong> Dan commanded, pointing to a football lying a few feet away, locking eyes on Damian with a smug expression on his face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the first time ever, Drew had two visitors at his spot. By the looks of it, he was gonna have three more visitors in a minute or two.</p>
<p>While Drew wondered what was going on, Damian knew what was about to happen. He hesitated, his eyes flickering nervously from the ball to Dan. <span class="PAF-Damian">"I-I'm sorry, wait a second..."</span> he stammered, his voice barely above a whisper.</p>
<p>Damian hurried to stand up and get the ball. A hammering fist to his stomach from Drew stopped him in his tracks and made him writhe.</p>
<p>Dan's expression darkened, one fist clenching at his side. <strong>"I said, get the ball,"</strong> he growled at Drew, his voice laced with menace. This growl was met by an unwavering gaze from Drew, who leaned back and rested on the bench behind him arrogantly. Damian's legs trembled harshly as he panicked. Drew interpreted the sound as Damian trying to stand up again, so he pronounced his intentions.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew:</span> Give him the ball and I kill you.</p>
<p>Enraged, Dan lunged forward, grabbing Drew's collar and pulling him to his feet. <strong>"Kill who, motherfucker?"</strong> he spat, his face contorted with anger.</p>
<p>Dan's voice was sharp and loud, speaking of a resolve that shook Damian deep down to his tailbone. But there was no moment in Damian's life that scared him more than the sight of Drew pulling a switchblade out of his back pocket.</p>
