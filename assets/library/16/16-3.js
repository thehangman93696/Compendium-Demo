    <p>Michael eventually fell asleep. He dreamed of Sherrie and Adrian for the sleepworthy part of the night. Adrian putting his hand on her shoulders, pulling her closer to him without asking, kissing her hand, and asking her to go out without panties&hellip; that shit was really hot.</p>

    <p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Hey. Good Morning.</p>
    <p><span class="Milena">Milena:</span> Morning.</p>
    <p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> What the fuck? What&rsquo;s wrong with you today?</p>
    <p><span class="Milena">Milena:</span> Nothing.</p>
    <p>She knew that he knew she knew he&rsquo;s holding something from her.</p>
    <p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Whatever. Let&rsquo;s go to class.</p>
    <p><span class="Milena">Milena:</span> You go. I&rsquo;ll hang around until the class starts.</p>
    ${storyImageRecurring('school_hall')}
    <p>They never went to class earlier than they should have. That wasn&rsquo;t the cool thing to do and they both knew it. She was more suspicious of him now. Michael pivoted, eyes scanning the bustling hall. Hands on hips, he sighed.</p>
    <p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Alright. If you don&rsquo;t wanna be my friend anymore, I&rsquo;m gonna find a new one.</p>
    <p><span class="Milena">Milena:</span> (chuckle) Don&rsquo;t be a drama queen. Come on.</p>
    <p>His gaze swept the hall, seeking a loner. He thought it&rsquo;d be funny to approach someone new and strike a conversation while Milena watched. He had no desire to talk to Milenja and he wanted to kill some time till the day began. He wanted easy to approach, perhaps a nerd or a shy girl, but not too pathetic to stick around after the convo. All he wanted was to put Milena in her place after all.</p>
    ${storyImageCenter('R/0')}
    <p>A girl stood out in the crowd. She walked with her gaze roaming around, examining people&rsquo;s faces, as if searching for someone. Not the kind of girl he was looking for she was too stunning, way out of his league. Yet, she intrigued him.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;You know what? Fuck it. You think if Adrian was here he would&rsquo;ve been afraid to approach this girl? No fucking way. He would&rsquo;ve run at her and pulled her panties down!&rsquo; he thought.</p>
    <p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Hey, are you looking for me?</p>
    ${storyImageRight('R/1')}
    <p><span class="Robin">Robin:</span> Pardon!</p>
    <p>Michael&rsquo;s sudden presence startled Robin, yet she was happy to be talking to someone. Tucking a strand of hair behind her ear, she fidgeted with it as they spoke.</p>
    <p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> You&rsquo;re not from here, are you? Is this your first day in school?</p>
    <p><span class="Robin">Robin:</span> Oui, I came from France. I&rsquo;m... looking for zee class 12A.</p>
    <p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> That&rsquo;s my class. Do you want me to take you there?</p>
    <p><span class="Robin">Robin:</span> S&rsquo;il vous pla&icirc;t.</p>
    <p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Ok, give me your hand.</p>
    <p><span class="Robin">Robin:</span> What-</p>
    <p>With a gentle grasp, he took hold of her hand, guiding her behind him as they made their way towards his class. She protested, urging him to slow down, followed by a string of French words he didn&rsquo;t understand. He found the girl super light. Pulled her behind him with no trouble at all.</p>
    <p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> It&rsquo;s ok, it&rsquo;s right here, we&rsquo;re almost there, just walk with me.</p>
    <p><span class="Robin">Robin:</span> Ok.</p>
    ${storyImageRight('R/2')}
    <p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> There you go. That&rsquo;s class 12A. It has the coolest kids in the whole school. I&rsquo;m half of them.</p>
    <p><span class="Robin">Robin:</span> Merci beaucoup, Monsieur. Oof, you Amerians are rushing to do everything!</p>
    <p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> I don&rsquo;t know about that really. You&rsquo;re really cute, but you&rsquo;re gonna have to speak in English if you wanna make friends here. People will be intimated by you if you say things they don&rsquo;t understand, cuz it makes them look stupid. Alright, that&rsquo;s pretty much it, see ya later, hotstuff!</p>
    <p>He turned around, ready to leave.</p>
    <p><span class="Robin">Robin:</span> Ot-Stoof?!</p>
    <p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> (shifting back) It means you&rsquo;re very beautiful. (sigh) You&rsquo;re gonna struggle here acting like this. I guess I&rsquo;ll have to be your friend until you learn to blow your own sail. I&rsquo;m Michael. What&rsquo;s your name?</p>
    <p>The girl stood with her mouth wide open in awe. He thought he came off too strong.</p>
    <p><span class="Robin">Robin:</span> I&rsquo;m Madame Robin.</p>
    <p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Don&rsquo;t you mean... Mademoiselle Roban? (with a smirk)</p>
    <p><span class="Robin">Robin:</span> Mademoiselle is out of use. All French women are called Madame now.</p>
    <p>He was trying to be a smartass; instead, he came off as just an ass.</p>
    <p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Yeah, right. I should focus more on French class, I guess. Nice to meet you, Roban.</p>
    <p><span class="Robin">Robin:</span> Non, non, it&rsquo;s Robin. R-o-b-i-n.</p>
    <p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Robin!</p>
    <p><span class="Robin">Robin:</span> (chuckle) Oui, Rob&igrave;n is fine.</p>
    <p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Nice to meet you, Madame Robin.</p>
    <p>He raised her left hand to his lips, pressing a gentle kiss upon it.</p>
    <p><span class="Robin">Robin:</span> Mon Dieu! Do you Amerians keess your teachairs&rsquo; hands?</p>
    <p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> What? You&rsquo;re a teacher?!!</p>
    <p><span class="Robin">Robin:</span> Ah, I&rsquo;m ze new French teacher.</p>
    <p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> I&rsquo;m sorry, Ms. Robin, I&rsquo;m so sorry. I didn&rsquo;t mean to hit on you like that. It&rsquo;s just... You&rsquo;re too beautiful!</p>
    <p>Yes, he said that. He was out of words and out of thoughts for a second and he blurted out the only thing that came to mind.</p>
    <p><span class="Robin">Robin:</span> Ah, non, non, don&rsquo;t apologize. I came &lsquo;ere to learn zee Amerian culture and teach French. I&rsquo;m &rsquo;appy to see you acting naturally. Please, treat me like zee other teachers, oui?</p>
    <p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> No no no, we don&rsquo;t do that here!</p>
    ${storyRightImageRecurring('milena_hall')}
    <p><span class="Milena">Milena:</span> No, Madame Robin, we don&rsquo;t kiss teachers&rsquo; hands here. Michael however is a natural born handkisser, he loves to kiss all girls&rsquo; hands.</p>
    <p>Milena&rsquo;s sudden appearance pleased him at first, because he knew she could save him from the embarrassment. But as she extended her hand for him to kiss it, a surge of anger flooded him. Without hesitation, he delivered a sharp slap to the back of her outstretched hand.</p>
    <p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Shut up, Milena!</p>
    ${storyImageCenter('R/3')}
    <p>Michael turned back to Robin, who observed the scene with great interest, poised to enter the classroom.</p>

    <p><span class="Milena">Milena:</span> I know! But... since when do you have the courage to talk to a hot girl anyway, let alone kiss her hand? Who the hell kisses hands these days? Where did you learn that from?</p>
    <p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Milena, I can tell you my secret. I can tell you everything, in extreme detail, but I won&rsquo;t. It will scar your little mind and turn you wild.</p>

<p>French was the first class of the day. Despite Robin being quite a capable teacher, Michael struggled to focus, as he couldn&rsquo;t maintain eye contact with her for long, consumed by embarrassment over their interaction before class. It didn&rsquo;t help that she frequently eyed him during the class, as he was the most familiar to her among the bunch. Fortunately to him, the class concluded without to engage with her even once.</p>

<p>Alas, his least favorite class.</p>
<p>Michael had no interest in filling his eyes or ears with Calvert, whom he considered a pretentious bitch. He slouched, head on arms, above his desk. Trying to nap.</p>
<p>Minutes passed. Till, suddenly, gentle taps on his shoulder. Likely Milena&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p><span class="Calvert">Calvert:</span> Mr. Alexander! Pray tell, why are you not giving your attention to me?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> I&rsquo;m sorry, what?</p>
<p><span class="Calvert">Calvert:</span> Ugh. (imitating his voice) I&rsquo;m sorry, what? Oh my, how absurd. Mr. Alexander, is this the manner in which you were reared to address your superiors?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> I&rsquo;m sorry, ma&rsquo;am.</p>
<p>Another grunt escaped Calvert&rsquo;s lips. He rose from his seat, offering another apology, this time with a bow.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Forgive me, Ms. Calvert. My sincerest apologies.</p>
<p>Giggles echoed from a couple of girls.</p>
<p><span class="Calvert">Calvert:</span> You never cease to disappoint me, Mr. Alexander. Each year, it seems I am fated to instruct the class in which you are enrolled, and each year you astound me with your lack of proficiency in your native tongue!</p>
<p>He hated that bitch.</p>
<p><span class="Calvert">Calvert:</span> Why can&rsquo;t you be more like your wondrous sister Kelsi? It&rsquo;s a marvel that you share blood, for you are nothing alike! She is clever and genteel and comely, while you... you&rsquo;re just yourself, Mr. Alexander.</p>
<p>Laughter engulfed the class, as if he was just roasted. And he was roasted indeed. Never had someone humiliated him so hard with just words. Blood coursed through his veins.</p>
<p>He hated that bitch. Hated her posh way of talking, her old-fashioned clothes, her high on a high-horse attitude. Hated every goddamn thing about her. He slept during her class because she was boring as hell, so what? She didn&rsquo;t have to humiliate him in front of everybody.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t the first time she did it either. She loved stepping on low-grade students. She got off on it. And she was obsessed with the &lsquo;clever&rsquo; ones. Obsessed? Nah, that didn&rsquo;t cut it. He needed a bigger word for how infatuated and enamored she was with the smart kids. Ugh, fuck it, he couldn&rsquo;t think of one. This year, with the classes reshuffled, he had the bad luck of ending up in the same class as Kelsi. Now, every time Calvert humiliated him, she had the perfect opportunity to compliment Kelsi. Two birds with one stone. He&rsquo;d never see the end of it.</p>
<p><span class="Calvert">Calvert:</span> What do you have to say for yourself, Mr. Alexander?</p>
<p>He could feel his blood boiling. What did he have to say for himself? A fucking lot. Any other day, he&rsquo;d have been too embarrassed to keep his head up; today, he was inspired. He wasn&rsquo;t the same guy he was yesterday. He&rsquo;d show her. Just wait and see.</p>
<p><span class="Calvert">Calvert:</span> Mr. Alexander!</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, he couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore, there was only one way he could become a man!</p>

<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> Is it normal to kiss a student&rsquo;s hand inside the school, Michael?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> I&rsquo;m sure the boys and girls do a lot more than that inside the school grounds, Ms. Roberts.</p>
${storyImageCenter('J/8')}
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> The bad boys and girls do that, I&rsquo;m sure. Michael, I feel like I don&rsquo;t know you anymore. You used to be one of the calmest and most polite students in this school.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Me? Are you really talking about me, Ms. Roberts? I don&rsquo;t remember being so genteel and comely before.</p>
<p>Roberts&rsquo; surprise was evident in her expression. She Attempted to maintain composure as Michael mocked Calvert, until a chuckle escaped her lips despite her efforts. She quickly returned to seriousness.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> Don&rsquo;t interrupt me while I&rsquo;m talking, please.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> See? That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about. You used to be a model student. I used to take you as an example when I<br />was guiding the other students on how to behave. I can&rsquo;t do that anymore.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> In the first 3 days of this semester alone, you proved to be one of the naughtiest boys in school. You hit on Gina and almost started a fight on the first day, yesterday you bullied Jenny in the hall, and today you kissed the new teacher&rsquo;s hand and called her beautiful out loud, and, worst of all, you were rude to Ms. Calvert in front of your whole class. What happened to you, honey? I know you&rsquo;re not like this.</p>
${storyImageCenter('J/9')}
<p>Michael wasn&rsquo;t surprised she knew all that. Roberts, the school&rsquo;s sweetheart, held connections with almost every teachers and students. Known for her gossip and her motherly vibe, she drew students to open up to her. Roberts was obsessed with highschool drama was her domain, always in the know about the latest buzz on who&rsquo;s dating who and who just broke up or had a fight, and all these things.</p>
<p>A master of information extraction. Her network of informants, both teachers and students, unwittingly fed her with everything interesting and talkworthy the minute it happened. None of them realized they were her sources; she simply had a knack for getting what she wanted out of people.</p>
<p>Roberts was one of the most powerful people in the school&rsquo;s staff, second only to Principal Colette. Despite holding no administration or HR roles -she was only a teacher-she commanded authority over nearly all. Her close bond with the Principal played a role in that, but it was chiefly people&rsquo;s natural affection people that solidified her power.</p>
<p>Now, Roberts wasn&rsquo;t blind to Michael&rsquo;s less-than-exemplary record. His prowess in mathematics left much to be desired, yet occasional flashes of brilliance piqued her interest in him. She was aware of him being closer to a bad bay than a good one, yet she also recognized his latent potential for academic success. Whether he had academic potential or not, Michael enjoyed his image in Roberts&rsquo; eyes. It made him feel he was better than he actually was.</p>
<p>His heart fluttered as she spoke to him. Striving to embody the image of a model student in her presence became second nature. Repetition molds a person. When someone calls you something over and over again, and you allow them to, you&rsquo;ll unconsciously start playing that role, whether it was true or not, whether you liked it or not. That&rsquo;s what she did to him. Yet, he genuinely wanted to make her happy. Few things held greater significance than her smile and the sparkle in her eyes directed his way. She was more than a teacher; she felt like a mother to him. For a long time, he was ashamed of bearing impure thoughts of Roberts, it felt so taboo to desire her like he did, but he couldn&rsquo;t help it. She&rsquo;s so un-fucking-believably hot!</p>
<p>Two words came to his mind at that moment. Teasing and controlling. That&rsquo;s what Sherrie was before she met Adrian. Isn&rsquo;t Roberts exactly like the girl Sherrie used to be when she was young? Roberts definitely charmed everyone laying eyes on her. She&rsquo;s also teasing and controlling like no one he&rsquo;s ever seen. Sherrie told a boy how far he could get with her.<br />Roberts told you what you could be!</p>
<p>Sherrie played games with Adrian and he won. Roberts is playing games with him as well, he thought. She&rsquo;s teasing him and she&rsquo;s trying to control him. He&rsquo;s not sure if there&rsquo;s anything sexual in Roberts&rsquo; game but it is clearly a woman&rsquo;s game. He wants to win this transaction.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> Don&rsquo;t try to be a bad boy, Michael. You&rsquo;re better than this.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> I&rsquo;m not!</p>
<p>Roberts was startled.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Ms. Roberts, errr&hellip; Can I call you Jen?</p>
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> Of course, honey, you can.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Jen, I&rsquo;m not trying to be something that I&rsquo;m not. I was only being honest to myself. I talked to Gina because I have feelings for her, I didn&rsquo;t know she had a boyfriend. I teased Jenny because she was clumsy and she hit me, she deserved it. I kissed Ms. Robin&rsquo;s hand and told her she was beautiful because that&rsquo;s exactly what I wanted to do and that&rsquo;s what I was thinking of at the moment. I, honest to God, thought she was a new student because of how beautiful she was. And Ms. Calvert... Ms. Calvert is a pretentious bitch!</p>
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> (gasp) Oh my god! How dare you?!</p>
<p>Disbelief etched on her features as she stared at him. Rising from his seat, he closed the distance, locking eyes with her.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Jen, look me in the eye and tell me that Ms. Calvert isn&rsquo;t a bitch.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> Get back to your seat!</p>
<p>Michael immediately retreated to his seat.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> I&rsquo;m sorry, Jen, I didn&rsquo;t mean to-</p>
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> I&rsquo;m Ms. Roberts to you, young man!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Yes, ma&rsquo;am.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> I was trying to be nice to you and you insist on being an insolent petulant boy! You know what your problem is, Michael? You&rsquo;re arrogant. You need to be put in your place.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> Michael, you should know very well that I have no tolerance for impudence at all! I don&rsquo;t wanna see you talk about any teacher with anything less than absolute respect and admiration. Do you understand me?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Yes, ma&rsquo;am.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> I will let it go this time because I know you and Ms. Calvert don&rsquo;t like each other, but if I see this attitude from you again, I assure you you&rsquo;ll get in serious trouble.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> I understand.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> Now I can let your remark about Ms. Calvert go without punishment. What you did with Ms. Robin can&rsquo;t go without a severe punishment. It is unacceptable for a student to have romantic feelings for a teacher, let alone advance on her like that. I will call for a school board meeting tomorrow and we will have to summon your parents and have a real talk<br />with them before we can determine if you can continue in this school.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> No no no, what?! What did I do for all that?</p>
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> (another gasp) You don&rsquo;t know what you did?! You flirted with a teacher! I honestly can&rsquo;t believe you did that. Aren&rsquo;t all these girls in school enough to fill your greedy eyes?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> But... she&rsquo;s hotter than all of them.</p>
<p>A minute ago he learned that being blunt didn&rsquo;t work with all women. He forgot when Sherrie told him what worked with her seldom worked elsewhere. After being scolded his Roberts, he reverted to his usual self. Yet it didn&rsquo;t take him long to be blunt with her again. However, this time he wasn&rsquo;t being blunt for the sake of being<br />cool, simply didn&rsquo;t know what else to say.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> Hotter than ALL of them? (sigh) Michael, you&rsquo;re a liar. I can see through you and I can read your lies. You&rsquo;re saying you thought she was a student but you told her she&rsquo;s beautiful right after she told you she was a teacher. Is that true?</p>
<p>Whoever reported the incident to Roberts about didn&rsquo;t miss a single detail.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Yes, ma&rsquo;am. But I had no dirty intentions saying that. I was shocked to learn she was a teacher and didn&rsquo;t know what to say, so I blurted out the first thing that came to my mind.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> Oh yeah? And what&rsquo;s on your mind now, Michael?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> You look really beautiful today, Ms. Roberts.</p>
<p>Roberts closed her eyes, smiling to herself. Savoring his compliment, she sucked in her lower lip, gently biting down before drawing a deep breath. Her expression akin to someone cherishing a fleeting moment, relishing the sensation as it settled deep within her, or perhaps recalling another cherished memory from the depths of her heart.</p>
${storyImageCenter('J/10')}
<p>Her eyes flickered open, her face refreshed, a newfound sparkle igniting within. A mischievous glint danced in her warm gaze towards Michael.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> Would you say I&rsquo;m hotter than those school girls as well?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> By a mile!</p>
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> Ahahahaha.</p>
${storyImageCenter('J/11')}
<p>A burst of laughter escaped Roberts as she rose, hands on hips. After a futile attempt at seriousness, a smile lingered on her face, refusing to be concealed.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> Michael, I&rsquo;ve known you for so long, you&rsquo;re my sweetheart, but you can&rsquo;t talk to your teachers like that.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> I&rsquo;m sorry, Ms. Roberts. I&rsquo;m such a good boy I can&rsquo;t hold my thoughts from you.</p>
<p>She chuckled at his poor attempt at teasing her.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> Mmhm. What other thoughts do you have? Tell me.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Ms. Roberts, I&rsquo;ve always thought you had an amazing sense of fashion. I like your new suit a lot.</p>
${storyImageCenter('J/12')}
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> Oh, you&rsquo;ve noticed it&rsquo;s a new one!</p>
<p>She pivoted to showcase her suit a little bit more.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> Do you like it?</p>
<p>He just told her he did. She craved more compliments.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> I do. Ms. Roberts, if you were a student, I bet you would&rsquo;ve been the most popular girl here.</p>
${storyImageCenter('J/13')}
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> Really?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> You&rsquo;re by far... I- I can&rsquo;t say more than that.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> Why not?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> I&rsquo;ll get in serious trouble.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> No, you can tell me. I promise you won&rsquo;t go in trouble.</p>
<p>Silent he remained. His gaze locked with hers.</p>
${storyImageCenter('J/14')}
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> Tell me.</p>
<p>Roberts&rsquo; voice suddenly softened as she arched her back and tilted her body forward slightly. Her skirt was raised as a result, showing the back of her thighs.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> If I were a student, would you have kissed my hand as well, Michael? *in a teasing voice*</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Ms. Roberts, if you were a student... I would&rsquo;ve kissed your feet.</p>
${storyImageCenter('J/15')}
<p>Roberts let out a hearty belly laugh. Bent at the waist slightly to hold her stomach while laughing, and that gave him a peak under her skirt. He felt uncomfortable looking at Roberts&rsquo; ass, yet he was unable to tear his eyes away.</p>
${storyImageCenter('J/16')}
<p>Roberts caught him sneak a peek under her skirt. Her smile vanished, replaced by narrowed eyes and a chilling countenance, though a hint of lingering warmth remained on her flushed cheeks from all that laughter. Slowly, she made her way to a desk in her office, settling upon it with deliberate grace.</p>
${storyImageCenter('J/17')}
<p>She beckoned him to her with one finger.</p>
${storyImageCenter('J/18')}
<p>Heart racing, he rose from his seat and approached her with hesitant steps.</p>
${storyImageCenter('J/19')}
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> That was sweet of you, honey. I believe since you spelled your thoughts out, it will be easier for you to take them off your head. You should focus more on studying, there&rsquo;s a lot for you to learn this term...</p>
<p>She seized his collar, adjusting it with a gentle tug, her fingers deftly smoothing his shirt as she spoke.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> A handsome boy like you should be getting any girl he wants in this school, you just need a little more confidence in yourself. Now, know your place, and don&rsquo;t be greedy. Go for someone your age. If you look around, there&rsquo;s enough eye-candy to feed those voracious eyes.</p>
<p>She winked, tapping his chest twice.</p>
<p><span class="Jen">Jen:</span> You can go now. Don&rsquo;t worry about the meeting. Your naughtiness will go unpunished this time.</p>
<p>He was grateful for her. Roberts had proven herself time and again as the kindest woman in his world.</p>
<p>He tenderly raised Roberts&rsquo; hand and kissed it.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Thank you for the lovely conversation, Ms. Roberts. I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow.</p>
<p>Roberts chuckled, her right hand rising to cover her mouth as he pressed his lips to her left hand. With a nod, he departed her office.</p>

<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Sherrie!</p>

<p>Sherrie dropped on all fours almost immediately once she heard her master's voice.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Do you want me, master?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Come here, I wanna talk to you about something.</p>
${storyVideo('S/3', true, false, true, true, true)}
<p>Sherrie eagerly approached him, crawling closer with anticipation..</p>
${storyImage('S/5')}
<p>She settled before him, placing her hands on his lap, patiently awaiting his orders.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Remember what we talked about yesterday? About dominant and submissive people? I wanted to ask you something... Am I dominant or submissive?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I don&rsquo;t know, master. You are what you wanna be.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> I thought you said people are born like this.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Well, that is partly true. Everybody&rsquo;s born with a natural affinity to being dominant or submissive, childhood and youth play a big factor too, but people can change throughout their lives.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Well, you&rsquo;ve seen me since I was a little child. Do you think I&rsquo;m dominant or submissive?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Master, I was saying that people can change throughout their lives. A submissive child can grow up to be a very dominant man and vice versa. May I ask you why you&rsquo;re asking sir?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> I will tell you in a minute, but tell me what you think first.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Well, you&rsquo;ve always been stubborn and self-motivated since you were a child, and based on how you wanted to fuck me just to lose your virginity and didn&rsquo;t care about me, I think you&rsquo;re giving signs of being dominant, master.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> I knew you would say that because that&rsquo;s what you want me to be.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> No, master, I&rsquo;m being honest.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> All you women are the same. You want to change a man to be what you like.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> No, no, master, I&rsquo;m not trying to change you!</p>
${storyImage('S/6')}
<p>Sherrie&rsquo;s excitement bubbled over, her hands moving in rapid, eager motions above his thighs. She moaned as she felt his semihard cock ih is jeans.</p>
${storyImageLeft('S/5_1')}
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Sherrie, you&rsquo;re a bad girl and must be punished for your insolence.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Yes, master!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Alright, relax for a second. Here&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m asking you this. I have a girl... well I won&rsquo;t hide anything from you, there&rsquo;s a teacher in school that I&rsquo;m really attracted to, and she&rsquo;s of the controlling and teasing type, like you when you were young, and today I started flirting with her and... she scolded me for it, but at the end I think she gave me a little<br />reward after she put the rules on what I can do and what I can&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> She didn&rsquo;t say it out loud but I read it between the lines, that I can be a little bit \naughty\ as she says, as long as I don&rsquo;t go far and that I know my place, and... I think I liked it.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> You like that she was on top, master?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Well, when I stopped acting like someone I&rsquo;m not, she allowed me to look at her butt, and also, even if she would&rsquo;ve allowed me to do what I want, I wouldn&rsquo;t have known what to do. So, it&rsquo;s like, I was happy she took control of the situation. Sherrie, does that mean I&rsquo;m submissive?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> You said you liked it, master?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Well, I was a little bit ashamed of myself, but overall, yes, I liked it.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> That doesn&rsquo;t mean a lot, master. You don&rsquo;t have a lot of experience and she&rsquo;s an older woman, it&rsquo;s no wonder she got the better of you. Remember, before meeting Adrian I enjoyed controlling boys and men around me, I found true pleasure only when I met him. Maybe when you get more experience, you&rsquo;ll find your true side.</p>
${storyImageRight('S/7')}
<p>He grasped her chin, tilting his face downward to meet her gaze.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> (sigh) I guess I&rsquo;ll have to be dominant just for you, my Sherrie.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Yes, master. I&rsquo;m all yours.</p>
<p>Sherrie wrapped her lips around his thumb, sucking it.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Wow, your tongue is so wet and slimy.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> It&rsquo;s not as wet as my pussy, master.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Shit, that&rsquo;s so hot.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Let&rsquo;s go to your room, master, before I wet the floor.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> You can&rsquo;t wait for it, huh?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I&rsquo;ve wanted to take your cock inside me for so long, master.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> What the fuck? Sherrie, I just turned 18. Are you a pedophile?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> You&rsquo;ve had a man&rsquo;s aura around you since you were so young, master.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Well, I&rsquo;ve been waiting to fuck since the day I was born! Ummm, Sherrie, I want you to teach me everything about sex, and also teach me how to deal with the girls and older women at school. I thought I had learned something from your story yesterday but I guess I still have a lot to learn. My beautiful servant, follow me to my room.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Yes, master.</p>

<p>Sherrie and Michael hastened upstairs to his room without delay. He was super excited to finally have sex.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Alright, where do we start?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> We can start with some foreplay, master. Girls your age will be reluctant to have sex with you if they&rsquo;re not in the mood. I am already wet but I think you will benefit a lot if we start with some kissing and touching first.</p>
<p>He had requested she taught him everything about sex but he didn&rsquo;t mean literally everything. He knew kissing and touching very well. His expertise lay in the basics; what he missed was the advanced. Nonetheless, her allowed her to lead the lesson the way she wanted. She was the expert here.</p>

<p>Sherrie reclined on the bed while Michael remained standing, awaiting instruction. A giggle escaped Sherrie&rsquo;s lip.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> You might want to close the door, master.</p>
${storyImageRight('S/10')}
<p>Of course he did. Had Kenzie or Mom happened to pass by the door and see them, that would be really awkward and embarrassing. Let alone the fact that Mom would definitely kick Sherrie out of the house if she knew Michael was having sex with her. He swiftly regained his bearings, darting to the door to shut it firmly, restoring a sense of privacy. Then he returned to his sexy Sherrie. He took his clothes off and settled on the edge of the bed, facing her directly.</p>
<p>Sherrie sat up on her knees on the bed and they started with light kissing and touchy-feelies. She pecked his lips twice before he got the courage to pay her back with a couple of his own. He kissed her lower lip and gave it some attention until he collected the courage slide his tongue in her mouth, Sherrie was a fantastic kisser. His tongue wasn&rsquo;t frozen, nor did it move randomly in all directions, like the girls he had kissed before did. Her tongue movements had rhythm and purpose. He also noticed the way she moved her head a lot when she kissed, always tilting it in a way that complemented her tongue movements.</p>
<p>Her mouth had a unique taste, sweet, and it was hot too. Do women&rsquo;s mouths get sweeter as they grow up? He didn&rsquo;t know. The mouths he kissed didn&rsquo;t taste. Sherrie&rsquo;s tongue was also unbelievably wet. He had to pull out from the kiss a couple of times just to swallow the honey she dripped into his mouth. Sherrie liked it when he swallowed her spit, he noticed that each time he gobbled her spit, she&rsquo;d attack him and pull him back to her, kissing him even more voraciously than before. He questioned his slave&rsquo;s submissiveness but he didn&rsquo;t complain. He liked it better like this. Sherrie knew that.</p>
<p>She placed his hand on her shoulder. He showed off his knowledge of touchy-feelies and began rubbing her shoulders and arms as they kissed, then slid his hands to her tits and squeezed them firmly, which made her moan and take her tongue out for a fresher. The moment he felt her hot breath on his face, he took his turn in offense and intensely lip-carressed her neck, which prompted a louder moan.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Woah, what was that about?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> My neck is really sensitive (huff), master!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Did I do something wrong?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> No, no, no, master, you&rsquo;re doing great! I think we can skip to the next part.</p>

<p>Sherrie shed her pantywear spread her legs wide for Micahel.</p>
${storyImageRight('S/12')}
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Would you like to fuck me, master?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Sherrie, you&rsquo;re a bad girl.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Why, master!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> You told me you&rsquo;ll teach me everything. To go from kissing straight to fucking seems like a stretch to me. I feel like we&rsquo;re missing a step in between.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> We don&rsquo;t need any more foreplay, master, we both can&rsquo;t wait for it.</p>
<p>He thought she was manipulatiing him . Trying to tell him what he wants and doesn&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Sherrie, are you really a slave?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Yes, master, I&rsquo;m yours.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Does a slave tell her master what to do?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> No, sir, I&rsquo;m sorry. This will never happen again.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Does a slave tell her master what to want?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> No, master.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Then why are you trying to tell me what I want?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Forgive me, master! Ah!</p>
${storyImage('S/13')}
<p>He pinched Sherrie&rsquo;s pussylips powerfully as she talked. She screamed.</p>
${storyImageLeft('S/14')}
<p>Sherrie guided him, naming each part of her fruit. Plump, yielding, juicy&mdash;pleasure in every touch of her pussylips. Yet, one anomaly&mdash;the apex, hard and swollen; caressing Sherrie&rsquo;s clit felt weird and unsatisfying to him. Michael&rsquo;s touch began to falter, unlike Sherrie&rsquo;s wonderful responses to them. Then, a sharp shift in Sherrie&rsquo;s sounds. The became high-pitched and abrupt, it sounded like she was hurt.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Am I doing something wrong? You sound like you&rsquo;re hurt.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> No, master, you&rsquo;re doing great. It&rsquo;s just my pussy is extremely sensitive. The way you&rsquo;re doing it would be fine with most girls. Don&rsquo;t mind me.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Not bad for a first-timer, huh?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Oh, master, I have no doubt in my mind that you&rsquo;re dominant. You&rsquo;re a natural.</p>
<p>Is he really? He wasn&rsquo;t trying to control Sherrie per se, just got mad because he thought she was fooling him, playing him; and he acted upon an impulse. He knew that a woman&rsquo;s pussy was the most sensitive part of her body, and he wanted to punish Sherrie for thinking she can manipulate him.</p>
<p>Anxiety crept in on him, things escalated quickly beyond his comfort. Heart is racing, breath shallow. While one hand caressed and his lips touched and kissed Sherrie, his other stroked his cock. Irritation is growing, cumming is looming. He had the need for a slower rhythm, a moment to catch his breath.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> What makes you say so?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> The way you punished me for talking up to you, master, and how you kept putting more pressure on me with your questions, it made me feel like I want to do anything to please you.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> So what? I like hurting bad people. Does that make me dominant?</p>
<p>He gave no chance for Sherrie to speak. Clenched her pussylips tight, tensely pulling them taut. Sherrie, silenced herself by force, hands over mouth. And she shuddered as he pulled her fat pussy lips even harder.</p>
${storyImageRight('S/15')}
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Sherrie, I&rsquo;ve made up my mind. I&rsquo;m not gonna fuck you.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Why, master, what did I do?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> You&rsquo;re lying to me and manipulating me. All this talk about dominance and submission is bullshit. I thought you were going to teach me but all you&rsquo;ve done is confuse me. I don&rsquo;t know what the hell is dominance and I don&rsquo;t know what the hell I wanna be. Why did this shit have to be so complicated?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I&rsquo;m sorry, master.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> You said one should lose their virginity to someone special, right?</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t answer.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> You&rsquo;re not worthy of taking my virginity, you&rsquo;re just a horny bitch with some sick fetishes, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I- I don&rsquo;t know what to say, master.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> I&rsquo;ll help you. Answer this: Two nights ago, when you sucked my cock, you looked disappointed to see me cum early.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I wasn&rsquo;t, master.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Stop lying to me! You said I didn&rsquo;t get enough of you or something?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I didn&rsquo;t like that you came before me, master.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Is it a big deal if I cum before the girl? Should I let her cum first? Or do we have to cum together?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> A man feels very satisfied after the cum, women can orgasm many times before they can feel satisfied. Most submissives will-</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Cut that shit!</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Most women find their satisfaction in pleasing the man rather in the bodily orgasm they get.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> You&rsquo;re contradicting yourself. If I cum easier, that&rsquo;s better for the woman.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Yes, but the journey to a man&rsquo;s pleasure is enjoyable, sir. It&rsquo;s like what a climber feels while climbing a mountain. The higher the mountain, the more ecstatic they are to finally top it, also the journey itself is also quite pleasurable, with all its suspense and shocks and little rewards.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> You won&rsquo;t relate to it because you&rsquo;re a man and you&rsquo;re still young, sir. To you, satisfaction is orgasm. To women, intellectual and sexual pleasure go together. A woman will<br />hardly be satisfied with sex that she doesn&rsquo;t get mental or emotional satisfaction from, even if she orgasms. That satisfaction comes from her relationship with the man, and the idea of pleasing someone that is very hard to please, is something that intrigues a lot of submissive women and turns them on.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> You will understand later in life that men, too, get significant pleasure from sex accompanied with some intellectual or emotional gain, and that sex with someone you don&rsquo;t have a relationship with is bland and tasteless, much like masturbation is.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> So, when do I know if I can cum?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Whenever you feel like it, sir. Remember, sir, that your partner has to seek your pleasure, and if you are hard to please, their pleasure will definitely come along the way and they will be extremely satisfied when you climax. The girl has to try as hard as she can to please you, don&rsquo;t resist it, otherwise it&rsquo;s not fun for you or the woman. You just need to learn to control it.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> How do I control it?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I will teach you, master, if you would allow me.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Hell yeah! I mean... What do you want?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Come here and lie on the bed.</p>
${storyImageRight('S/16')}
<p>He lay as Sherrie wished, concealing his thrill. Sherrie, unabashed in her enthusiasm, climbed on top of him, grabbing his cock. He allowed her to stroke his cock. Her fingers trailed over the length of his cock, slow caressing as she spoke.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> The first rule is to breathe well. Your stamina is proportional to how well you breathe. Breathe deeply from your stomach and let it out slowly. Control your heartbeat and don&rsquo;t let it run too fast. If your heart beats too fast, you will want to cum, just so you can relieve yourself from the physical toll that sex puts on your body. You can only control your orgasm if you can control your breath and your heartbeat.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Weightlifting and cardio training are a good way to learn how to control your breathing and heartbeat. In fact, exercising is essential for any man who wants to increase their stamina. It increases the range where you&rsquo;re comfortable keeping your heartbeat at, hence prolonging the sweet time you have when you&rsquo;re extremely aroused.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Sherrie, how do you know all this stuff?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I&rsquo;m a scientist, sir. I specialize in Mathematics and Physics but I have wide knowledge in Biology and Psychology too.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Keep going.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> The second rule is to be mindful. Don&rsquo;t let your mind wander and stay in the moment. Try to focus on the woman you&rsquo;re with and give her your attention. If you focus too much on yourself or wander around, you will make yourself cum before you really enjoy it.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> The third rule is to practice a lot and consistently. When you masturbate or have sex, focus on the muscles around your penis contracting as you go, and when you feel too much heat in your cock, stop and take a rest, then continue again. This will help you understand what makes you cum quickly and you will have more control over it with time. If you are breathing well and are mindful when you practice, you will learn how to direct your pleasure to other points in your body, or even to the woman you&rsquo;re with, and then only then sir, you will have control over yourself and the woman you&rsquo;re with, and you will both be truly happy.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> We should start practicing, then.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Would you like to fuck me, master? That would be-</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Sherrie, how long do you think a man should be able to fuck for?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Well, on average...</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> I&rsquo;m talking about you. How long should a man last for to be in your taste?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> But, sir, I&rsquo;m a very experienced woman!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> And I would like to please that woman.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> 30 minutes, sir!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> 30 what?!!</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I&rsquo;m being honest with you, sir.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Damn. If I can masturbate for 30 minutes straight, does that mean I can fuck a woman for 30 minutes?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> No way, sir. What you do alone is incomparable to what you do with a woman.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Alright, Sherrie, I&rsquo;ll make you a deal. If you can train me to go for 30 minutes straight, I will fuck you and give you the best sex you ever had in your life.</p>

<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Oh, master, you don&rsquo;t have to be insecure about it. You can train by fucking me.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Get to work, slave!</p>
<p>Sherrie was literally fucking drooling from excitement.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Oh, master, I can&rsquo;t wait for that day. May I suggest we switch to a blowjob?</p>

<p>That was another wonderful blowjob from Sherrie. She was more comfortable taking his cock into her throat now and she was hungrier for it. He strived to follow her instructions, regulated his breath, fixated on her presence. This exercise felt 10 better than the last, yet he didn&rsquo;t last a second longer.</p>

<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Sherrie, Sherrie, I&rsquo;m gonna cum.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Give it to me, master, give it all to me.</p>
${storyImage('S/21')}
<p>Sherrie pulled him to the edge of the bed, sat on her knees, opened her mouth and stuck her tongue out. He knew she wanted his cum on her face. For a second there, he didn&rsquo;t wanna do it. He felt it a bit... too mean. Definitely unnecessary he thought. He didn&rsquo;t mind it when she swallowed it, maybe she likes the taste of cum, or she didn&rsquo;t want to clean afterward. But what&rsquo;s the point of shooting it on her face? Is it only because it&rsquo;s derogatory? Is that the fun in it?</p>
<p>Derogatory or not, he&rsquo;s cumming on that bitch&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Thank you so much, master.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> I thought you said women didn&rsquo;t like it when a man cums early.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Mmmm, your cum tastes so good.</p>
<p>He will never understand how women work.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> You&rsquo;re not a woman, you&rsquo;re a cumrag. That&rsquo;s what you like to be, huh?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> I&rsquo;m anything that you want to use, master.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Did you cum?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Not yet, master.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Wanna go for another round?</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Yes, please!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Stand up.</p>
<p>Sherrie rose, He slid his hand on her legs, felt her pussy.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> You&rsquo;re so wet!</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> For you, master.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> Good, stay like that till tomorrow.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> What, why, master?</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> I&rsquo;ll wait till tomorrow. Let&rsquo;s see how long you can last without cumming. I don&rsquo;t want you to masturbate all night like you did on that night after your date with Adrian. You&rsquo;re not allowed to cum until I make you do it myself.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> No, no, no, master!</p>
<p>Sherrie clasped her legs tight, knees bending until they hit the ground. She yawned loudly as her master demanded.</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> You&rsquo;re not allowed to wear panties till then either.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> But, master, your mother! Your sisters!</p>
<p><span class="Michael">Michael:</span> I don&rsquo;t care. If you drip your juices on the floor, don&rsquo;t clean it. I expect to enter the house tomorrow and find it all smells like you.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Ahhhhh!</p>
<p>Sherrie&rsquo;s face sunk into the floor, panting hard. Her whole body trembled, like she was caught in a quake.</p>
<p><span class="Sherrie">Sherrie:</span> Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, master!</p>
<p>Her voice, deep and shaky, spoke of pain. A twinge of guilt crept into Michael; perhaps he&rsquo;s too harsh. Sherrie&rsquo;s horny, for sure, that&rsquo;s not a bad thing. He should make her cum right now and get on with it. He wanted to make her cum, but he sleepy and tired and wanted to rest. He eventually decided it was better to wait till tomorrow, and he didn&rsquo;t want her to bring herself to orgasm. He wants to do it himself!</p>
<p>Michael sent Sherrie out of his room.</p>
