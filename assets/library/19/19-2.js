<p>Damian and Alex got caught making out in one of those godforsaken empty classrooms before the day even began. Tangled up and lost in each others' mouths, the door suddenly creaked open, and there stood the janitor, eyes wide, mouth hanging open like he’d stumbled into a ghost. Without a word, he spun on his heel and fled. By lunchtime, the whole school had the story in their mouths. </p>

<p>Drew was on a bench outside, scribbling down thoughts in his notebook. When boredom hit, he&rsquo;d lift his eyes, scanning for anything to distract him from his dull routine. He spotted Damian off in the distance, talking to some other guy. Drew&rsquo;s heart did that stupid flutter when he saw Damian&rsquo;s beauty, the kind that made you feel like a fool.</p>
${storyImage(2)}

<p>They were in the same class, and since their chat yesterday, Drew had been sneaking glances at him, when no one was looking. Damian had this way about him&mdash;light, delicate, like he could float away if the wind blew too hard. Drew would find a bit of pleasure in Damian&rsquo;s cute face or when he heard his melodic voice. His delightful manners and strange joy intrigued him. It was off to see a boy look and act so girly-like. Drew would always look away the moment he realized he was staring, and he did that now, but he couldn&rsquo;t shake the grim look on Damian&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>He wondered if the guy with Damian was the same one he&rsquo;d been caught with that morning. Yeah, Drew had heard the rumors too, about how Damian might get in deep shit, maybe even expelled. Drew didn&rsquo;t really care, except for the part where he felt a twisted relief at the thought of Damian being gone. It would would take away that gnawing anxiety that crept in when Damian was in the peripheral, a feeling he couldn&rsquo;t justify. But even then, Drew found himself unable to focus on his notebook for long, his eyes drawn back to Damian and Alex, like a moth to a flame. He chuckled to himself, clicked his pen, flipped to a fresh page, and scrawled in large type.</p>
<p>I watch people too.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s what we do.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, limp dicks? Can&rsquo;t find a real girl to fuck so you have to resort to this?&rdquo;</strong> Josh, the star quarterback, sneered as he and his posse surrounded Damian and his boyfriend. <strong>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid of catching gay cooties, little Damian boy?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Damian&rsquo;s heart hammered in his chest as the jeers and insults washed over him.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;What are you doing here, queers?&rdquo;</strong> Dan joined. <strong>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go fuck each others&rsquo; asses in the janitor&rsquo;s room? I head it&rsquo;s empty, I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Dan tried to pull Damian&rsquo;s arm but Damian pushed it away. His cheeks burned with anger and humiliation as he tried to stand tall in the face of their mockery. <span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;Go bother someone else, Josh,&rdquo;</span> He managed to say, trying to keep his voice steady despite the fear coursing through him.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Oh look, little Damian is trying to be tough,&rdquo;</strong> one of them taunted. But then the jocks suddenly erupted into laughter as they watched Alex turn around and flee when most of the jocks had their attention on Damian. Damian turned his head and watched Alex running away. He felt betrayed, disgusted. His hands curled into fists in a failed attempt to extinguish his fury. When Josh stepped in closer, Damian&rsquo;s hands involuntarily loosened and they trembled more and more every inch the tall muscular beast got closer to him.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Aww, how cute. You look like a girl who desperately needs to be fucked,&rdquo;</strong> Josh spoke in a low intimidating voice. <strong>&ldquo;I bet you&rsquo;re gonna get off just by having so many studs around you. Hmm? Little faggot!&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Josh's fingers dug into Damian's sensitive nipples with a vicious grip, causing him to let out a blood-curdling scream. As he tried to break free, the jocks surrounding him delivered brutal slaps to his face and neck, keeping him dazed and disoriented. Damian managed to get his nipples free from Josh's grip but just as he thought he had a chance to escape, Dan's boot came crashing into his butt, sending him hurtling into Josh's grasp once again.</p>
<p>This time, Josh twisted his fingers into Damian's chest, causing him to convulse in pain and anger. Face red as hot iron, curled in helpless rage, hands rapidly raining against the immovable Josh's chest, Damian had nothing to do but spit in Josh's face.</p>
<p>But before Josh could retaliate with a slap, Dan caught his hand and stopped him. As they exchanged words, eyes of the small gang turned to Drew standing far away, to Josh's left, his chest heaving and clearly ready to fight.</p>
<p>Drew had seen the jocks closing in on Damian and his friend, just like the many around him. Not a soul stepped in to help, and most turned their eyes away. Just a couple weak boys dominated by the bullies, no big deal. Those who knew it was the faggots taking the heat didn&rsquo;t even bother to hide their interest.</p>
<p>When Alex bolted, Josh and his crew closed the circle tighter around Damian, six of them, big and mean, blocking out the light. Only a few could see what they were doing to Damian, and Drew was one of them. Some teachers caught a glimpse too, but they just kept on walking, pretending their day was just fine.</p>
<p>Drew tried to brush it off at first. He watched, a little pity creeping in, but it was fleeting, like the last drag of a cigarette. But then he saw Damian&rsquo;s face twist into something ugly, a hideous display of rage, and that&rsquo;s when he stood up, couldn&rsquo;t help himself. He caught Dan's eye who immediately tipped off Josh. As soon as Drew&rsquo;s eyes locked with Josh&rsquo;s, the bastard backed off, called his pack, and left Damian alone.</p>
<p>Damian stood there, dazed, his eyes darting around, searching for a teacher, an ally, anyone who might&rsquo;ve come to his rescue. But all he got were soulless, judgmental stares, pity mixed with disgust.</p>
<p>Then he felt it&mdash;a breeze, a small reprieve from the fire burning inside him. He looked up and saw Drew, sitting there coolly, without a care, like he was out of this world; close by, just out of reach, in the direction Josh had seen trouble coming from.</p>
<p>In that moment, Damian didn&rsquo;t care about his public humiliation, didn&rsquo;t care about the shame, the whispers, or even the pain in his body. What really tore him apart was the look Drew gave him, just a quick, icy glance before he went back to his notebook like what he saw wasn't even worth his attention. Damian lingered, trying to muster the courage to go over and say something, anything, but couldn't find anything to say. He knew if he tried, Drew might just lose his temper and give him a beating worse than what Josh&rsquo;s goons could&rsquo;ve dished out.</p>
<p>Defeated and utterly alone, Damian turned and headed back to his classroom.</p>

<p>Drew arrived home late after meeting up with his gang.</p>
${storyVideo('jaime_fuck1/enter_home', animate=false)}
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m home,&rdquo;</span> He called out as he walked through the door. In a deviant house like his, you&rsquo;d assume there was no sense for simple greetings. But he and Jaime tried their best to pretend they had a normal life, so he always called out when he entered the door - especially if he knew she was inside.</p>
<p>His voice trailed off in the sounds of deep growls and loud sultry moans, interrupted by the sweetest of cackles.</p>
<p>The growls were familiar to him-Dad&rsquo;s usual music while fucking Mom mercilessly-but the moans that drowned out everything else were too sweet to belong to her.</p>
<p>With slow, scared steps, Drew made his way toward Jaime&rsquo;s room, where the sounds came from. His heart pounded so violently in his chest that it felt like it could burst at any moment, yet he couldn&rsquo;t stop himself from moving closer to his worst nightmare. Jaime&rsquo;s door was wide open, a rarity in this house. Drew stepped over and peeked through the open door.</p>

${storyImage('Jaime/10')}

<p>A few days ago, Drew saw Jaime poised on her neglected ballet bar, dressed in one of her old ballet costumes. She didn't 
notice him, absorbed in a reminiscient reverie. He watched her from behind the wall, not wanting to distract her. It reminded him of 
when he used to hide behind the couch as a child and gawk at his older sister while she was training. He&rsquo;d wonder if she was real.</p>


${storyImage('Jaime/11')}
${storyImage('Jaime/12')}
<p>The first girl Drew loved was Grace. He met her at the sports club for the first time when he was 9. She had a soft nose with a sharp edge and she reminded him of Jaime and so her approached her and romanced her, as well as a child could. He&rsquo;d hit puberty very early and he attributes that to his parents. He recalls the weird tingle in his penis when his mother walked in on him in the bathroom one day and pissed in front of him. Though his curiosity about sex had started earlier than that. The urge to repeat Mom and Dad&rsquo;s groping, kissing, and touching on the face, the nipples and between the legs, had grown in him as early as he could remember. One day he cornered Grace in a storage room at the club and they made out, and that was when he got his first hard-on. When he got home, he touched himself in the bathroom thinking of Jaime.</p>
<p>He was thinking of Grace at first, and how nice her kiss and touch felt, but he couldn&rsquo;t stop shake Jaime off his mind.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d have no problems visualizing violating Grace, but not his sister. He didn&rsquo;t think of Jaime sexually at first, just remembered moments when he was mesmerized by her, those times he watched her silently admiring, the shivers she sent down his spine every time she glanced back.</p>
<p>It was no coincidence that when Drew urged for a girl in his hands, he dreamed of his sister. Jaime was his kind of girl, his definition of a woman, of beauty.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t want her presence in his mind while awkwardly playing with his dick, yet he would be lost in the pleasure of fantasizing about her voice and her touch.</p>
<p>He wanted to stop, but it felt so unbelievably good.</p>
${storyImage('Jaime/13')}
<p>And as he touched himself, he couldn&rsquo;t help but imagine she was with him, all alone, undressing and teasing him until he couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how he was set over the edge for the first time and unloaded over his stomach in the bathtub.</p>
<p>He would love to believe it was his first and last time.</p>
<p>Other than the first time, Drew never admitted to himself to having masturbated to Jaime again.</p>
<p>Yet, every time he scanned through a porn magazine, every girl he kissed, every whore he slept with, nothing could compare to the intense arousal he felt whenever he thought of Jaime.</p>
${storyCenterImage('Jaime/9', true, 'png')}
<p>She was the forbidden fruit that he couldn't resist. As much as he tried to push those awful thoughts away, they inevitably crept back into his mind every time he sought pleasure from other women.</p>
<p>She was his ultimate fantasy, always lingering at the edge of his consciousness, tempting him with her angelic figure and seductive gaze.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d deny it for his life, but fact of the matter is, Drew had never climaxed unless her name passed through his lips first.</p>
${storyCenterImage('Jaime/8')}
<p>Jaime was four years his senior. She'd always held the impression Drew was a shy and timid child and they didn't spend much time together.</p>
<p>Drew was a boy of peculiar inclinations, a creature of solitude who savored the quietude that others found oppressive. 
He cherished being alone and spoke only to shut people up, and that made him a target for bullies, who wanted to demistify his enigmatic presence.</p>
${storyImage('Buck/park')}
<p>At the tender age of twelve, as the light of the afternoon sun filtered through the leaves in the town&rsquo;s central park, Drew found himself besieged. He had been lost in the intricate patterns of his thoughts, sketching them with artistic precision, when a group of boys from his school&mdash;less boys, really, or half-formed men, more like wild dogs&mdash;incomprehencibly descended upon him, all fists and fury. Their cruelty was swift and brutal, yet Drew, all skinny limbs and nerves, somehow managed to shove them off and sprinted away, his heart pounding and legs burning as he weaved his escape.</p>
${storyImage('Buck/shop')}
<p>That&rsquo;s when he found himself at Sam&rsquo;s shop, still trembling.</p>
<p>Sam was a military veteran who owned a convenience store downtown. He was quite loved by people in Drew&rsquo;s neighborhoud but a kid once told him Sam was a dirty criminal and a drug dealer.</p>
<p>When a little buck walked into Sam&rsquo;s store with a deathly stare on his face and asked for a knife, Sam asked with a fatherly smile <span class="PAF-Sam">&ldquo;What kind of knife?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;One that could kill,&rdquo;</span> Drew said, dead serious.</p>
${storyImage('Buck/1')}
<p>Sam burst out laughing. Drew was right. A dangerous man who sold drugs knew how to get weapons, and might as well sell them. He didn&rsquo;t know that Sam would be reluctant to sell a weapon to a child before giving him a real hard time for it.</p>
${storyImage('Buck/2')}
<p>Nevertheless, Sam was amused a lot by the scrawny boy&rsquo;s naivity and courage, and eventually suckered Drew into buying a switchblade at double its price, $100 out of the $107 he&rsquo;d scraped off his daily allowance over the years, almost everything he had.</p>

`
<p>His room smelled like stale sweat and regret.</p>
<p>Drew didn&rsquo;t even know how to open the damn thing at first. He sat on the edge of his bed fumbling with the mechanism, feeling like an idiot.</p>
${storyImage('Buck/3', fig="", cl="", sty="", 'png')}
<p>Buck-110 Auto Knife, the one he&rsquo;d been swindled into buying for an extremely high price, was stubborn. A hundred bucks for this useless piece of steel. It felt like a scam, but what didn&rsquo;t? It resisted his touch. He&rsquo;d push the button and it won&rsquo;t click. He&rsquo;d flick it and it won&rsquo;t open. He&rsquo;d push the button and flick the knife and it was heavy and stubborn. Not only was it sold to him at an unreallistic price, the knife was faulty, it didn&rsquo;t work. You couldn&rsquo;t even pivot the blade out of the handle if you tried with both hands.</p>
${storyImage('Buck/4', fig="", cl="", sty="", 'png')}
<p>He persisted. Day after day, he would sit on the edge of his bed, or on the floor. His fingers, calloused from writing, traced the ebony hardwood handle and the cold steel, feeling the weight of the knife, its balance. Then he&rsquo;d push the button and flick the knife. Didn&rsquo;t work. He tried again. After hundreds of tries, he finally managed to flick it open once, by sheer luck. It opened with a smooth, aesthetic flick. The blade was sharp and unforgiving but it never hurt Drew once. He closed the knife fairly easily but couldn&rsquo;t get to flick it open again right away. He&rsquo;d grind at it again, until it opened once more, again, by sheer luck.</p>
<p>Over the following weeks, Drew played with 110 constantly. Sometimes it worked, most times it didn&rsquo;t. But as his jerks of the blade became more precise and less stuttery, the blade opened more frequently. He&rsquo;d learn a specific press of the button, not too much pressure, not too light, along with a particular flick of the wrist, to increase his chances in persuading the blade to open.</p>
<p>Yet each flick of the switchblade remained a gamble. Would it open this time? Would it catch? It was quite satisfying to watch and feel the blade open in his hand, the unpredictable<br>nature of the act made it extremely satisfying to him. It felt like whenever he was eager for it to catch, it wouldn&rsquo;t listen, but when he let it be and didn&rsquo;t expect anything of it, he&rsquo;d be quite more successful in opening it. Like the damn thing had a mind on its will.</p>
<p>Had Drew thought of oiling the blade or bringing it to a cutlery shop or a bladesmith, he would&rsquo;ve fixed it, but Drew was more stubborn than the blade, he&rsquo;d learn its secret the hard way.</p>
<p>It mused him that he had a tool only he could&nbsp;use. Mind you, it took a very long time before Drew used 110 for what he bought it for, but he would use if for the small stuff if he could. Cutting ropes, peeling apples, carving his name on the benches and the trees in the park, boyish stuff.</p>
<p>It became an extension of his hand, practicing on it religiously whenever he could, till he had more callouses on his fingers from friction with his newest obsession than his pen and pencil. His flicks became cleaner, his presses more decisive. Click. Snap. A victory over the blade. Satisfying click. Crisp snap. A fuck you to the world. Open. Close. Click. Snap.</p>
<p>Over and over, until that specific motion to have it open was muscle memory, second nature.</p>
${storyImage('Buck/5', fig="", cl="", sty="", 'png')}
<p>By his 14th birthday, after thousands of hours of practice, countless repetitions, Drew had worn down its resistance and finally tamed the stubborn blade. It became no longer a question of if it would open, but how quickly, how precisely. He&rsquo;d still never rely on it completely. He&rsquo;d keep that&nbsp;superstition that if he expected it to open, it won&rsquo;t. Yet it never failed him since then. Friends came and went, relationships started and ended. 110, however, never&nbsp;let him down.</p>
<p>And when he was 16, after he saw Jaime crying over some asshole she used to date in college who abused her, that blade found its purpose.</p>
<p>Drew went after the guy, cornered him in an alley. He beat the hell out of him, and when he had him on the ground, he pressed that blade under his chin and promised him that if he ever touched Jaime again, he&rsquo;d finish him. The guy didn&rsquo;t need much convincing. A little bitch with a silver spoon up his ass. He was shaking like a leaf under Drew's knife, all his swagger gone, replaced by pure fear.</p>
<p>That guy wasn&rsquo;t going to take his beating and sleep on it though. He paid some thugs to teach Drew a lesson. Offered them a grand for every tooth they knocked out of Drew's mouth.</p>
<p>Drew would find himself cornered this time. Three towering, muscular black thugs surrounding him in the same damn alley he attacked that motherfucker in.</p>

${storyImage('Buck/shop_interior')}
<p>The dull hum of flickering fluorescent lights, illuminating a cluttered yet oddly inviting convenience store.</p>
<p>Sam leans against the counter, an old man with a rugged face that tells stories he never will. He&rsquo;s rocking a tracksuit that&rsquo;s seen better days and a gold chain that probably hasn&rsquo;t. Next to him, his daughter Shamika, a 12-year-old with attitude, sits on a stool, lazily painting her nails. She&rsquo;s half-listening to her dad ramble about school, her oversized hoodie swallowing her frame.</p>
<p><strong>BAM!</strong> The door crashes open. Enter Tyrone, Jax, and Rico&mdash;Sam's boys, and they&rsquo;re a mess. Bloodied everywhere and looking like they'd lost a bar brawl. Tyrone and Jax are barely holding it together.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Sam">SAM</span><br>What the hell happened to you boys?!</p>
<p>Sam bolts from behind the counter, zeroing in on Tyrone. Rico swipes the junk off a table and lays Tyrone out.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Tyrone">TYRONE</span> (gritting teeth)<br>We were slashed.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Sam">SAM</span><br>Slashed?! What the hell does that mean? What happened to you?</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Tyrone">TYRONE</span> (shouting)<br>I don&rsquo;t know, boss. We were out there getting slashed up!</p>
<p>Shamika, without a word goes to the back of the store, brings a metal tray with medical supplies and a bowl of water. She&rsquo;s by her father&rsquo;s side, handing him cotton, wet towels, threads, and needles as he works on Tyrone&rsquo;s wounds. The air is thick with the grunts of pain and the metallic tang of blood.</p>
<p>Sam presses an alcohol-soaked cotton ball on the gash across Tyrone&rsquo;s forehead. The slash runs the width of his forehead. Tyrone screams like a bitch.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Sam">SAM</span><br>Who the hell did this to you? Was it the Vipers?</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Jax">JAX</span><br>No, boss, he was a kid.</p>
<p>Jax&rsquo;s voice is strained as he holds a blood-soaked rag to his arm.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Sam">SAM</span><br>A kid? What kid?</p>
<p>No answers. Sam&rsquo;s patience is wearing thin. He stitches Tyrone&rsquo;s forehead with a mix of fury and skill. The scene is chaos&mdash;groaning men&nbsp;and the clatter of medical supplies, and Shamika&rsquo;s steady hands passing tools to her father&nbsp;are keeping it all from falling apart.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Sam">SAM</span><br>I SAID WHAT KID, JAX?</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Jax">JAX<br></span>Some fancy ass college kid paid us to rough up some punk for him. He told us where to find him and we rolled up...</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Sam">SAM<br></span>And then what?</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Rico">RICO<br></span>And then those fools were cut up like chicken breasts, boss. Look at them! Dude was quick as lightning. I barely touched his shoulder and then there was a flash of bling and a snap and suddenly I&rsquo;m covered in my boys&rsquo; blood.</p>
<p>Rico&rsquo;s finally speaking up, the fear in his voice more than the blood on his clothes. Unwounded but&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;most nerved of them all. He sat on the floor and didn&rsquo;t do shit to help Sam and Shamika.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Sam">SAM<br></span>A kid sliced ya&rsquo;ll up on his own?</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Rico">RICO</span><br>I don&rsquo;t know how he did it, boss. It was like he was a ninja or some shit. They were chopped up before I could even blink. I thought we was getting shot at so I ducked for cover. Then the kid ran away and Tyrone went after him and got fucked up nicely.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Tyrone">TYRONE<br></span>I&rsquo;m gonna find that little bitch and fuck him up! Ughhhhh.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Sam">SAM<br></span>Who is this motherfucker?</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Jax">JAX<br></span>Just some clean white boy, probably still in high school. Got into a fight with an older dude over a girl and came out on top. Rich ass fool wanted to pay for revenge so we took the money.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Sam">SAM<br></span>Y&rsquo;all jumped a high schooler? What the fuck is wrong with you?</p>
<p>Sam&rsquo;s booming voice silences the room.&nbsp;He doesn't touch kids. Everyone knows that.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Jax">JAX<br></span>Boss, the money... That dude offered us a lot.</p>
<p>Sam&rsquo;s anger shifts to a calculating look.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Sam">SAM<br></span>How much?</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Tyrone">TYRONE</span><br>He gave us 5k upfront and said he&rsquo;d give us a stack for every tooth we knocked out his mouth.</p>
<p>Sam keeps sewing Tyrone up,&nbsp;not saying a word.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Shamika">SHAMIKA</span><br></span>So a white boy did all this to y&rsquo;all?</p>
<p>Shamika asks with an unimpressed expression as she tends to Jax&rsquo;s wounds.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Jax">JAX<br></span>I&rsquo;d get slashed any day if it means you&rsquo;ll take care of me, cutie.</p>
<p>Jax teased her with a fatherly smile and a slightly intimidating voice, not about to let a brat mock him. Shamika presses a little harder on one of Jax&rsquo;s wounds. He yelps, and she chuckles. It&rsquo;s funny to her how men acted most tough at the times they were least.</p>

`<p>Drew stumbles home like he&rsquo;s in a dream, adrenaline and terror mixing in his veins. He sneaks in through a window and drags himself to the bathroom. He fills the tub, still in his bloodied clothes, and sinks into the water. His hands won&rsquo;t stop shaking until he finally passes out from exhaustion.</p>
<p>Two hours later,&nbsp;he's rudely awakened by his mother banging on the bathroom door. He drains the tub, showers off, and hears his parents moaning and thudding against the bathroom door.</p>
<p>For a week, Drew&nbsp;is too scared to leave the house, too scared to face the world. When he finally does, he&rsquo;s jumpy as hell, avoiding alleys like they&rsquo;re death traps.</p>
<p>His greatest mistake was walking into Sam&rsquo;s store. He steps up to the counter, eyes on Shamika, and asks for a gun.</p>
${chapterStars()}
<p>Shamika doesn&rsquo;t even blink. She heads to the back and calls her daddy out.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Sam">SAM</span><br>What for?</p>
<p>As Drew&rsquo;s about to answer, the door chimes. His head snaps toward it. Rico walks in. Drew doesn&rsquo;t recognize him, but Rico sure as hell recognizes Drew. His face goes white.</p>
<p>Sam catches Rico&rsquo;s look, vaults over the counter with surprising agility.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Shamika">&ldquo;Daddy!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Shamika&rsquo;s scream rings through the store, as her father&rsquo;s blood scatters on the shelves and tables around.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Lightning Drew</span>. That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;d call him. Over his criminal life, he&rsquo;d earn other names. Some knew him as Switchblade, more knew him as the Arsonist. Lightning was his first nickname.</p>
<p>Sam dived at Drew and before his feet land on the ground, Drew&rsquo;s Buck, with its helicream handle, flashed in the air three times. Sam didn&rsquo;t see Drew&rsquo;s hands or his blade, but he saw its golden blur. He held his arm in front of him, guarding his gut.</p>
<p>Drew slashed at Sam&rsquo;s arms and cheek but that didn&rsquo;t slow the veteran at all.</p>
<p>Sam delivers a brutal kick to Drew&rsquo;s ribs, sending him crashing into the shelves and tables behind him. He swiftly disarms Drew of his switchblade with another kick and knees Drew&rsquo;s side of the head before he can get up.</p>
<p>Drew is relentless. Even though he is concussed, he tries to get back on his feet immediately. His balance falters and he falls on his knees.</p>
<p>Sam pulls a gun, pressing it against Drew&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Sam">SAM</span><br></span>Stay still, or I&rsquo;ll blow your brains out.</p>
<p>Drew's bark shakes the place. He bites down on the barrel, tearing it from Sam&rsquo;s grip. He headbutts Sam in the gut. Rico finally decides to jump in, tackling Drew and pinning him down.</p>
<p>As Sam retrieves his gun and takes aim again, he sees it&mdash;the fire in the boy's eyes.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Sam">SAM</span><br>Hey, I remember you!</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Rico">RICO</span><br>You know this guy, boss?</p>
<p>Sam laughs darkly.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Sam">SAM<br></span>Little sucker walked in here after school once with a backpack on and demanded a switchblade. Barely tall enough to see over the counter and he thought he ran this place. And I ended up selling you that switchblade, didn&rsquo;t I?</p>
<p>He picks up the blade from the floor.&nbsp;Drew stays silent, just staring.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Sam">SAM</span><br>How&rsquo;d you get so good with that knife?</p>
<p></p>
<p>No answers.</p>

<p>Sam offers Drew a spot in his crew, tells him to think it over. The next day, Drew shows up at the store, black eyed, bruise-faced. Shamika ducks behind the counter when she sees him. Drew asks what he has to do.</p>
<p>Sam doesn&rsquo;t rush it. He gives Drew small jobs&mdash;scare a guy, lift some stuff, run with Tyrone and Jax while they're selling. The guys give Drew a hard time, still holding a grudge, but they don&rsquo;t cross him. Sam&rsquo;s orders.</p>
<p>They rough him up a little&mdash;enough to let him know he&rsquo;s still the new kid.&nbsp;Cuff his ears, shove him around, make him wear a black ski mask on their night runs.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re only scary if they think you&rsquo;re black,&rdquo;</strong> they say. Drew doesn't slice their faces up, upon Sam's orders. He can't stand up for himself but he doesn't crack. He&rsquo;s got one move, that knife, and he sticks to it. They teach him the rest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kid is boring as hell.&nbsp;Kid&rsquo;s got no voice or vices, doesn&rsquo;t smoke&nbsp;and barely drinks, walks like he&rsquo;s always on a straight line. But they start seeing what Sam saw&mdash;a smart, tough kid who keeps his cool&nbsp;even when shit hits the fan. Always&nbsp;knows how to slip out of trouble, calm as stone and just as hard.</p>
<p>Drew builds a rep. Fast&nbsp;reflexes, the switchblade only he could flick open in a blink, and the silence, that damn silence&mdash;the kind that makes you uneasy. He learns to fight, to shoot, to watch the streets like a hawk. And before long, he&rsquo;s one of Sam&rsquo;s&nbsp;most trusted guys, third only to Jax and Tyrone. A hell of a feat for an 18-year-old white kid.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Jaime enters the room, on her tiptoes. In steps light and seductive, she struts in wearing only sheer black lingerie and panties.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_gallery/j1')}
<p>Dad&rsquo;s eyes narrow in anger as he remembers telling her not to prance around the house naked or else he would fuck her. Jaime leans against the wall, crosses her arms in front of her definatly, challenging him to do something about it.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_gallery/j2')}
<p>She watches them fuck. Her gaze locks with Dad&rsquo;s for a moment before sliding down to his cock penetrating Mom&rsquo;s wide hole. Her lips twitch subtly in a half smirk as she shifts her weight between her legs and sway her hips ever so subtly.</p>
<p>She gets more aroused by the second, starts touching herself.</p>
<p>Dad tries to ignore Jaime, clearly intent on going back on his word. Little did he know that his slip of the tongue kept Jaime on pins and needles half<br>the night thinking of him. Her nipples and pussylips are still flaming from how viloently she masturbated drunk on his thought, and she&rsquo;s still burning with desire.</p>
<p>He attempts ignoring Jaime still, but her body trembling and arching with desire in his peripheral, is impossible to ignore. He ravages Mom harder, who&rsquo;s crying out in pleasure beneath him, her pleasure intensified by watching Jaime wriggle in heat, begging for the stud, while she was keeping all of him for herself. Jaime teases and taunts<br>Dad slowly, mercilessly, plays with her hair and lips, the back of her neck, her stomach, her waist, her legs, slides her lingerie off her shoulder seductively, showing her burning nipples.</p>

${storyImage('jaime_gallery/j3_13')}
<p>When Dad&rsquo;s desire becomes too much for him to handle, he yells at Jaime to leave, and she only becomes more determined. She plays with her nipples and tits sensually, extra careful around that small bruise she made under her nipple last night. She runs her her hands over her neck, tight and sensitive with lust, softly a brush. Her own touch electrifies her. If these were a rough man&rsquo;s hands, her neck might tear.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_gallery/j4')}
${storyImage('jaime_gallery/j5')}
<p>Soon her own desire is unbearable by her, her thighs tighten and her hips grind restlessly against the wall.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_gallery/j6_1')}
${storyImage('jaime_gallery/j6_2')}
${storyImage('jaime_gallery/j6_3')}
<p>Her eyes shift back and forth between her burning crotch and Dad&rsquo;s thrusting hips. He slowed down to watch her back arch and bend against the wall in a wave asynchronously to his thrusts but in the same rhythm, each thud of her tailbone with the wall meets Dad&rsquo;s hips slamming Mom&rsquo;s. She imagines him fucking her and he can&rsquo;t unnotice that she does. Her eyes beg him to go easy on her. It drives him wild.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_gallery/j7_1')}
<p>Her hands slide down her waist.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_gallery/j7_2')}
<p>They feel and stretch her panties.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_gallery/j7_3')}
<p>She turns and twists.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_gallery/j7_4')}
<p>Teases freeing himself from their grasp.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_gallery/j7_5')}
<p>She pauses.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_gallery/j7_6')}
<p>That pause makes him even more wild with anticipation. His eyes could kill.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_gallery/j7_7')}
<p>And that makes her more determined.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_gallery/j7_8')}
<p>She undresses.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_gallery/j7_9')}
${storyImage('jaime_gallery/j7_10')}
<p>Her legs feel free but they&rsquo;re tight.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_gallery/j7_11')}
<p>He&rsquo;s still away. She claws her thighs with lust. She wishes she could claw and probe her itching insides.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_gallery/j7_12')}
<p>With a silent gasp, she begs for him to come over. He resists her still.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_gallery/j8_1')}
<p>She turns and bends. He sees every sexy part of her angelic self.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_gallery/j8_2')}
<p>Dad tries his damn best to ignore her, but his own increasing excitement betrays him, can&rsquo;t help but steal glances at Jaime while still fucking Mom. Jaime turns around, spreads her ass cheeks and exposes her rosy petals and<br>pink tight asshole completely. Her legs shake, her whole body trembles in fear and excitement at Dad&rsquo;s horrifying lustful eyes.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_gallery/j8_3')}
${storyImage('jaime_gallery/j8_4')}
${storyVideo('jaime_gallery/tease_1')}
<p>Despite his angry shouts for her to leave, Dad can&rsquo;t hide the glimpses of his ecstasy under his frown. He pounds Mom with all his might to unleash his anger or scare Jaimes off. But she taunts him further. She lies down on the bed, running her hands over herself, teasing herself until she reaches the brink of orgasm and stops, her eyes soften and her body shudders, desperately begging Dad to come finsih her off. And just when Dad thinks he can&rsquo;t hold himself it anymore, Jaime finally relents and skips out of the room with a sly grin on her face.</p>

`<p><span class="PAF-Dean">&ldquo;You little fucking brat!&rdquo;</span> Dad shouts as he barges into Jaime&rsquo;s room. Jaime's&nbsp;wiggling her hips on the bed, grinding her tailbone against the mattress, slowly, sensually, her back arched in a semicircle and her&nbsp;legs parted wide in a side split only a ballerina could hold.&nbsp;One hand claws the mattress behind her head, the other strokes her clit through the sheer fabric.</p>
<p>Dad approaches the little tease on the bed peacefully, she whimpers and closes her legs when he&rsquo;s inches away. Although she wants him, she instinctively pulls away at his extraordinary lustful gaze. Dad pulls her back by her neck...</p>

<p><span class="PAF-Dean">DAD</span> (pulls out of Jaime's mouth)<br>You can&rsquo;t walk around the house like that. You won&rsquo;t like what I&rsquo;m gonna do to you.</p>
<p>His voice is deep and calm.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Jaime">JAIME</span> (voice shaking)<br>I&rsquo;m so mad at you.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Dean">DAD</span> (intensely)<br>Why?</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Jaime">JAIME</span><br>The way you and Mom and do it makes me mad.</p>
<p>Her bitchy yet seductive attitude&nbsp;is exactly how he likes it. Dad sinks his hands between Jaime&rsquo;s legs. His fingers are rough and hard on Jaime&rsquo;s soft thighs. He gazes at Jaime&rsquo;s shivering crotch and growls. He pulls the strap of her panties and lets a mouthful of his spit slide down Jaime's stomach between her legs&nbsp;before releasing the strap. Jaime gasps. Dad carresses her pussylips in circles from above the wet cloth, already damp with Jaime&rsquo;s juices, now soaking with Dad&rsquo;s spit. His carressing of her meaty lips produces a light slurping sound that fades in the ambience of their steamy sighs.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Dean">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your boyfriend?&rdquo;</span>&nbsp;Dad hummed, his breath landing on Jaime&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Jaime">&ldquo;Ravage me like you do Mom,&rdquo; </span>Jaime demands wantonly, her voice&nbsp;sultry as fuck.</p>

<p><span class="PAF-Jaime">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not as hot as you are,&rdquo;</span> She replies, panting. It catches him off guard. It was too hot for him to fight it any mopre. Dad slips Jaime&rsquo;s panties off to her loud<br>ecstatic cackles.</p>

<p>Drew and Jaime&rsquo;s bond had grown stronger recently.</p>
<p>She started complaining more often about Mom and Dad&rsquo;s lewdness, probably due to her own pent up frustrations, and Drew shared her sentiments. They began talking more frequently than they ever had before.</p>
<p>They would scheme ways to pressure Mom and Dad into stopping their madness, or fantasize together about ways of humiliating them for it.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_fuck1/j5')}
<p><span class="PAF-Jaime">JAIME</span><br>Holy shit, Drew. You&rsquo;re an artist? Get outta here!</p>

<p>She&nbsp;was flipping through his notebook,&nbsp;eyes twinkling like someone who&rsquo;s just been told a secret.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_fuck1/j2')}
<p><span class="PAF-Jaime">JAIME</span><br>Damn, I never thought you were so cool, Drew. It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m just discovering you now.</p>
<p>They once got into this back-and-forth about their opinions about avant-garde dance. Drew&rsquo;s not one to back down, and when he won the debate&nbsp;and promised to take her to a live show to prove his point, she was practically purring, teasing him with a laugh that&rsquo;s all sex and no innocence.&nbsp;</p>
${storyImage('jaime_fuck1/j4')}
<p><span class="PAF-Jaime">JAIME</span><br>Wow, he&rsquo;s serious! Where has this Drew been my whole life?</p>
<p>He would passionately rant about Mom and Dad in front of her. Jaime always held the thought he was laidback, but the more they talked, the more he let his guard down, showing her that edge, the part of him that&rsquo;s got teeth.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Jaime">JAIME</span><br>Look at you all riled up now. You talk about how disgusting they are, but I bet you&rsquo;re just as dirty in bed.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_fuck1/jx5')}
<p>That&rsquo;s her, all fire and gasoline when Mom and Dad were brought up.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew</span><br>No, I&rsquo;m a lover.</p>

${storyImage('jaime_fuck1/jx1')}
<p><span class="PAF-Jaime">JAIME</span><br>Liar. You say that, but deep down, you know you want to ravage women.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_fuck1/jx2')}
<p>The sexual tension between them became unbearable. They would often lock eyes, to the sound of Mom and Dad&rsquo;s filthy moans and grunts, silently judging them.</p>
<p>She would tease him, move sensually around him, in her way that made his blood boil. And when his gaze lingered on her lips or dropped to her hips, she would scold him with nothing but a look.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_fuck1/jx4')}
<p>Every time their hands brushed, every accidental touch on dinner sent a shock through him. But she feels it too, he sees it in her eyes.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_fuck1/jx3')}
<p>They had many unspoken conversations, and that was Drew&rsquo;s favorite kind. He had never felt so intimate with someone doing things so simple. He had never felt so understood. Because he had never been in love before.</p>
<p>He worshipped her in his mind. He&rsquo;d obsess about her.</p>
<p>He confronted Mom and Dad and demanded they stopped their incessant fucking in front of them. Jaime would treat him like a hero. When he told her they&rsquo;d finally consider concealing themselves from them while having sex, Jaime practically jumped with joy.</p>
<p>It was the first time they scored a win over Mom and Dad.</p>
<p>Jaime ran to him, embraced him, and kissed his lips.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Jaime">JAIME</span><br>Are you fucking serious?</p>
<p>He would ask himself that question too.</p>
<p>Is it really happening?</p>
<p>Those few weeks were magical.</p>
<p>He finally has to admit to himself that he desires her sexually.</p>
<p>How can he take things further? He wondered.</p>
<p>Does he confess his love to her out of the blue?</p>
<p>Or should he take it slowly?</p>
<p>Perhaps compliment her legs when she wears shorts?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d probably say it was obvious, because she&rsquo;s a dancer. He could say it was just a brotherly meaningless compliment and that she was overrating herself. If he nagged her enough about it, she would let him feel her thighs.</p>
<p>He could even confront her about the time she kissed him on the lips. Demand another kiss. He could show her how good of a kisser he is, how good a lover he is. And if he could get her too aroused in his arms, maybe she&rsquo;d fall in love with him.</p>

<p>No, Drew, stop.</p>
<p>Stop thinking about her.</p>
<p>Stop stroking your cock to your fantasies of your sister.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was scared. He knew it was all wrong.</p>
<p>Mom and Dad wouldn&rsquo;t stop fucking in every corner in the house no matter how much he and Jaime complained. And then one day he caught her sneakily watching them with her hands in her pants.</p>
<p>He kept quiet about it, not wanting to embarrass her.</p>
<p>He got depressed. He knew she was secretly infatuated by Mom and Dad&rsquo;s rough sex. She contradicted herself too many times in front of him to unnotice it. But it still hurt. Yet he would ask himself.</p>
<p>Would she have ever kissed him if it wasn&rsquo;t for Mom and Dad&rsquo;s lewdness?</p>
<p>Why not take this as an opportunity?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the perfect opportunity. What can stop you?</p>
<p>They wouldn&rsquo;t have gathered on something else otherwise.</p>
<p>But he was scared.</p>
<p>He had a feeling this day was coming.</p>
<p>Last night he didn&rsquo;t leave dinner because of Mom and Dad having sex on the table, that was a very familiar sight. It was when he caught Jaime slipping her hand under her skirt and it drove him wild.</p>
<p>But then again. Would he have even caught that sight if it weren&rsquo;t for Mom and Dad?</p>
${storyImage('jaime_fuck1/j6')}
<p>Would he have ever seen her so violated if it weren&rsquo;t for Dad?</p>
${storyImage('jaime_fuck1/j1_1')}
<p>Would he have ever got to hear orgasmic yelps otherwise?</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Jaime">JAIME</span><br>Drew!</p>
${storyImage('jaime_fuck1/j7')}
<p>Jaime gasped when she saw Drew there at the door. Dad immediately folded her over and thrusted into her ass with brutal force, eliciting her to cry in pleasure and pain.</p>
${storyVideo('jaime_fuck1/11')}

<p>Dad had lost count of how many times she came. Jaime&rsquo;s inner thighs were glistening from her frequent releases.</p>

<p><span class="PAF-Jaime">JAIME</span><br>Mmhm, yes Daddy, I came so hard becasue of you.</p>

<p><span class="PAF-Jaime">JAIME</span>&nbsp;(sobbing sultrily)<br>You&rsquo;re burning my ass.</p>
<p>Dad knew she was tired and worn out, could feel her flaming asshole as he pounded into her raw, but he wouldn&rsquo;t stop grinding his cock against the red hot walls of Jaime&rsquo;s assholes if it meant tearing them down.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Dean">DAD</span>&nbsp;(harshly)<br>But you&rsquo;re still gonna take it, right?</p>
<p>She glanced at Drew, who was still frozen in shock at the sight before him. When their eyes met, his knees trembled beneath him and he shook uncontrollably. He was mortified, as if she&rsquo;d finally caught him gawking at her&nbsp;from a distance after all these years. He saw the mocking expression on her face when she saw his trembling form.</p>

<p>Drew ran to his room and slammed the door shut.He spun around himself in a frenzy, searching for something, anything, to distract him from the images burning into his brain.</p>
<p>His hands shook violently and his knees threatened to give out beneath him.</p>
<p>He pulled a porn magazine out of his drawer. Flipped the pages frenetically. He&rsquo;s looking for something to get that thought out of his mind, anything to steal away that feeling of being so defeated and aroused at the same time.</p>
<p>All these women. None of them compared to Jaime. All these faces come nowhere near hers.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_fuck1/j10')}

<p>That face.</p>
<p>Would he have ever imagined her orgasmic face?</p>
${storyImage('jaime_fuck1/j12')}
<p>Those feet. The way she arched her feet when she was about to orgasm. It was out of this world.</p>
<p>All those years he forbade himself the pleasure of her fantasy. Dad gave him dream material for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>He cursed himself for never acting on his fantasies about her, for denying himself the pleasure of her touch.</p>
<p>It could have been him.</p>
<p>But could it, really? Wasn&rsquo;t it the whole point that Dad&rsquo;s roughness turned Jaime on and flipped her over?</p>
<p>Would he have made he feel like that?</p>
<p>Would he have ever fucked in her ass?</p>
<p>Lying whore! All those times she pretended to agree with him about how disgusted they were by Mom and Dad&rsquo;s anal sex.</p>
<p>What a fool you had been, Drew.</p>
<p>You could&rsquo;ve never given her the pleasure that Dad did. Had you ever given a woman a full-body orgasm? Made a girl so submissive in your hands?</p>
<p>Dad gave you dream material for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you go back and watch? You don&rsquo;t want to miss this.</p>

<p>Your cock is painfully hard right now. Go back to her room and pull your pants down, free your cock from its strain. Stroke it to the sight of the most beautiful woman in the world writhing under the greatest fucker in it all.</p>
<p>But he couldn&rsquo;t bear to see her mocking face as he trembled in front of her.</p>
<p>Drew threw the magazine away and rushed to his computer. His legs still won&rsquo;t stop shaking from the adrenaline.</p>
<p>When his windows finally loaded, he saw that he had received a message on his messenger. With eager anticipation, he opened the chat only to find a message from an unfamiliar user.</p>

<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian says:</span><br>Hey you.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian says:</span><br>Asshole.</p>
<p>Drew&rsquo;s fingers raced accross the keyboard jitteringly.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew says:</span><br>What did you call me?</p>
<p>His impatience grew as he waited for Damian&rsquo;s reply. He was grateful that he was online.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian says:</span><br>I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian says:<br></span>Thought you were chill</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew says:</span><br>How did you get my username?</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian says:</span><br>Mr. Jones gave it to me</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew says:</span><br>What do you want?</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian says:</span><br>I&rsquo;m mad at you. You were supposed to protect me today. Why didn&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>What the hell is he talking about?</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew says:</span><br>I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian says:</span><br>Just play along man&nbsp;<img src="https://wordhtml.com/tinymce/js/tinymce/plugins/emoticons/img/smiley-yell.gif" alt="yell" />&nbsp;Anyway I just wanted to tell you that Dan and his friends reported you to the principal for bringing a knife to school. You&rsquo;ll have a meeting with him tomorrow. If they ask me, I&rsquo;ll deny seeing anything and I wanted to give you a heads up so you can come up with something to say. You&rsquo;re welcome&nbsp;<img src="https://wordhtml.com/tinymce/js/tinymce/plugins/emoticons/img/smiley-undecided.gif" alt="undecided" /></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew says:</span><br>Thanks for nothing. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. I&rsquo;m not going to school tomorrow.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian says:</span><br>Why not?</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew says:</span><br>I&rsquo;m running away.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian says:</span><br>Where? Why Drew?</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew says:</span><br>I don&rsquo;t belong here.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian says:</span><br>I feel I don&rsquo;t belong in school either</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew says:</span><br>I don&rsquo;t belong anywhere near.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian says:</span><br>I get that feeling a lot. It should be better soon I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian says:</span><br>Sorry but if it&rsquo;s not personal can you tell me what&rsquo;s wrong? Maybe I can help&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew says:</span><br>See ya</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian says:</span><br>What</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian says:</span><br>Wait</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian says:<br></span>Drew wait please</p>
<p><br>Drew suddenly heard knocking on the door.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Vanessa">MOM</span><br>Drew, come out!&nbsp;</p>
<p>He opened the door slightly and peeked from the side.</p>
${storyImage('mom_gallery/2')}
<p><span class="PAF-Vanessa">MOM</span><br>Dinner&rsquo;s ready.</p>
<p>She came by herself to his door to call him out. Of course. Dad has a new ${appendLinkInline('toy', 'section11')}

<p>The sound of a fork against a plate.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Vanessa">MOM</span><br>So, how was school today?</p>
<p>Drew ignores her completely.</p>
<p>She puts her hand on his shoulder, massages his shoulder and slides it down his back, carressing him in circles. The nasty bitch&rsquo;s hand is rough. She was more trying to provoke him, less soothing&nbsp;him. Drew turns his head and glares at her furiously. Her eyes lit when she saw his aggression.</p>
<p>Jaime&rsquo;s moans, running throughout the house endlessly, suddenly became clearer and louder. Dad lunges into the room, carrying Jaime impaled on his cock which was shoved up her ass to the hilt. Dad reaches the table, tosses Jaime in the air, unimplaing her and letting her freefall. Jaime&nbsp;is out of her mind. She doesn't try to land on her feet, lands head first on the table, the collision between her skull and the table echoes with a scary thud. Dad, without batting an eye to whether he might&rsquo;ve hurt Jaime or not, probably out of his mind too, slams his hand on&nbsp;her head, leans forward, putting most of his weight on her head, and strokes his cock intensely. Jaime panted heavily, her tongue struck out hungrily, staring directly at Drew but her eyes were so unfocused from the lust and pleasure, everything was a blur.</p>
${storyVideo('jaime_fuck1/table_cum')}
${storyImage('jaime_fuck1/jc1')}
<p>Dad came on Jaime&rsquo;s face. She sucked the remaining drips off the face of his cock, eyes locked on Drew...</p>
${storyImage('jaime_fuck1/jc2')}
<p>...and goes down to lick what had leaked to the floor.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_fuck1/jc3', fig="", cl="", sty="", 'png')}
<p>She doesn't leave a single bit.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_fuck1/jc4', fig="", cl="", sty="", 'png')}
<p>Like a true cumslut, she sweeps and licks and swallows every drop of cum that scattered around, on her skin, the table, and the floor. Had she noticeds the tiny droplets that&nbsp;scattered on Drew and Mom&rsquo;s plates, she&nbsp;would have devour&nbsp;them too.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_fuck1/jc5', fig="", cl="", sty="", 'png')}
<p>Drew felt a hole in his chest. It felt like his heart ceased beating and became one consistent ache. The sight in front of hit was so jarring and disturbing, it could have triggered him a heart attack.</p>
${storyImage('jaime_fuck1/jc6', fig="", cl="", sty="", 'png')}
<p>Dad fucked Jaime out of her mind and body and switched her into a depraved slut.</p>
<p>That body and face in front of him no longer resembled his sister&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Jaime was beautiful.</p>
<p>This thing isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They destroyed Jaime.</p>
<p>Drew got up and walked into his room. He went straight to his PC. Damian had sent him a few more messages.</p>

<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian says:</span><br>Where are you going</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian says:</span><br>Are you ignoring me? Hey I&rsquo;m worried about you please tell me</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian says:</span><br>Oh my god Im crying right now</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian says:</span><br>Drew please tell me whats going on with you</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew says:</span><br>Why are you crying?</p>
<p>Damian replied instantly, like he was eagerly waiting for Drew&rsquo;s response all this time.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian says:</span><br>It&rsquo;s just I relate to you and I don&rsquo;t want you to hurt yourself</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew says:</span><br>Are you actually crying?</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian says:</span><br>Yeah</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew says:</span><br>Show me</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian says:</span><br>Show you that I&rsquo;m crying?</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew says:</span><br>Show me your face, slut</p>
<p>Damian didn&rsquo;t reply right away. His messenger profile showed he had a webcam connected so he could definitely send a picture of his tears. Drew wondered if he&rsquo;d scared him off.</p>
<p>Then Drew&rsquo;s door handle turned and Mom entered the room without knocking. She was oiled up. The smell of her cheap lubrication oil filled the air. She put her oil bottle and a glass object on Drew&rsquo;s desk and stood provocatively in front of him.</p>
${storyImage('mom_gallery/1')}
<p><span class="PAF-Vanessa">"Drew, come to me,&rdquo;</span> Mom purred, her voice dripping with desperation.</p>
<p>She flared her hair to the sides and beckoned him to her with one finger.</p>
${storyImage('mom_gallery/3')}
<p><span class="PAF-Vanessa">MOM</span><br>I know you're mad. Take it out on me.</p>
${storyImage('mom_gallery/4')}
<p><span class="PAF-Vanessa">MOM</span><br>You've&nbsp;got your father's viciousness, don't you?</p>
${storyImage('mom_gallery/5')}
<p>She swayed and wiggled in front of him, seductively flaunting her sexy curves.</p>
${storyImage('mom_gallery/6')}
<p>Her filthy sexy curves.</p>
${storyImage('mom_gallery/7')}
<p><span class="PAF-Vanessa">MOM</span><br>I need a man right now, Drew, and you're what I got.</p>
${storyImage('mom_gallery/8')}
<p>She was horny, just as ever.</p>
${storyImage('mom_gallery/9')}
<p><span class="PAF-Vanessa">MOM</span><br>You know how to fuck a hot bitch in need, don't you?</p>
${storyImage('mom_gallery/10')}
<p><span class="PAF-Vanessa">MOM</span><br>Come fuck me now, Drew. I need you.</p>
${storyVideo('mom_gallery/tease1')}
<p>She gave him a good show. Drew watched everything, but he was not impressed.</p>
<p>He returned to his PC.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Damian says:</span><br>Why don't we meet so I could show you?</p>
<p>He wants to meet up? Drew looked behind him. Mom was teasing her asshole with that glass buttplug she brought with her into the room.</p>
${storyVideo('mom_gallery/tease2')}
<p>When Mom saw Drew looking at her again, she took the buttplug out, and spread and squished her ass for him. Her meaty asshole twitched rapidly, begging for his long cock.</p>
<p>Drew returned to the screen and sent Damian a last message.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">Drew says:</span><br>Ricci's club on 9th street. 8:30. Don't be late.</p>
<p>Then&nbsp;he turned off his PC.</p>
${storyImage('mom_gallery/29')}
<p>He got up and walked to the door. Mom was in the way.</p>
${storyImage('mom_gallery/30')}
<p>She sat up, thinking Drew was coming up to her.</p>
<p>She clung onto his legs and begged for his cock.</p>
<p>In a sudden burst of anger, he was about to slap her face clean, but he got a hold of himself at the last moment.</p>
${storyImage('mom_gallery/31')}
<p>His&nbsp;hand descended to his zipper. Mom raised her chin, expecting Drew's cock to spring out and land on her face.</p>
<p>Drew unzipped his pants and slid his limp dick out.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">"Mom, you couldn't make me hard if you were the last woman in the world,"</span> He said with complete disgust and disdain drenching his voice.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">"Move,"</span> he growled, pushing past her towards the door.</p>

<p>He was late.</p>
<p>The neon sign of Ricci&rsquo;s Club buzzed and flickered, casting a jittery glow over the sidewalk. Drew stood there, hands in pockets, tapping his foot to the deep thrum of the club&rsquo;s music vibrating through the walls. Damian approached, wearing makeup, a shoulderless crop top, jean shorts, and fishnet leggings.</p>
${storyCenterImage('damian_club')}
<p>Drew blinked, trying to process. <span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;You look... queer.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Damian raised an eyebrow, his lips curved in a playful smile. <span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;Weird?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;No, I said queer,&rdquo;</span> Drew reiterated, a touch more forceful.</p>
<p>Damian&rsquo;s smile faltered. <span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that word. Just say weird, Drew. Weird is fine.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Drew smirked, a half-laugh escaping him. <span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;Weird it is.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Drew grabbed Damian&rsquo;s hand and pulled him towards the entrance roughly.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;Whoa, Drew! Easy!&rdquo;</span> Damian laughed, stumbling slightly, surprised by Drew&rsquo;s dominance.</p>
${storyCenterImage('malik')}
<p>The bouncer, a hulking figure with a scowl etched into his face, nodded at Drew but put a hand on Damian&rsquo;s chest before he stepped into the club. <span class="PAF-Malik">&ldquo;Where the hell do you think you're going?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Damian opened his mouth, but words failed him. Malik&rsquo;s eyes narrowed. <span class="PAF-Malik">&ldquo;Fags aren&rsquo;t allowed.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Drew stepped between them. <span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s with me. You got a problem?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Malik hesitated, then stepped aside, showing great respect to Drew. <span class="PAF-Malik">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t grab too much attention, or you&rsquo;ll get me in trouble.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;Wooooo!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Damian&rsquo;s energy could explode this place. He jumped on a table and screamed.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;Damian, get down from there!&rdquo;</span> Drew yanked him down. Malik&rsquo;s warning was still fresh in his mind.</p>
<p>Damian jumped, grabbed Drew&rsquo;s head and pulled him down to his height. He stuck his forehead to Drew&rsquo;s and shrugged cutely, his eyes sparkling with mischief. <span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;Come on, Drew! Let&rsquo;s dance!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Drew pulled back and watched Damian dance in front of him. Boy wouldn&rsquo;t stop moving. His body felt hot from the inside, his stomach sizzled with the alcohol inside and his head felt hot since he saw Drew getting his way with the giant bouncer. He was extremely turned on and he couldn&rsquo;t hold himself.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;Dance with me, Drew!&rdquo;</span> Damian tugged at Drew&rsquo;s arm. <span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;This song is my jam!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dance,&rdquo;</span> Drew muttered, but he let himself be pulled onto the dance floor. They danced together to the pounding music.</p>
${storyImage('nightclub')}
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;Ahahaha. What the hell do you call that?&rdquo;</span> Damian imitated and mocked Drew&rsquo;s stiff moves. <span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;Just dance, Drew!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying, man.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;You look like a wooden log trying to balance itself!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Drew tried to justify his awkward dancing. <span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just not used to this... kind of music.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Damian cackled innocently like a child. <span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re hopeless, but I love it!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>They danced together. Damian danced effiminatively and seductively, like a girl, except that he danced so smoothly and so hotly he&rsquo;d put all the girls in the club to shame.</p>
<p>He pulled and moved Drew with him effortlessly and Drew was beginning to catch a rhythm.</p>
<p>Drew&rsquo;s eyes wandered around as he rocked himself to the beat. The alcohol was deep in his blood and he was getting horny as hell, and he was looking for a hottie as he danced.</p>
<p>He caught a decent lot of disdainful stares in his direction. Oh, yes he got quite some hateful eyes thrown at him, 2002 wasn&rsquo;t kind to crossdressers at straight bars. But he didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
${storyImage('nightclub_girl')}
<p>He noticed a group of girls dancing nearby without men, one of them caught his eye.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;Hey, can you play wingman?&rdquo;</span> Drew asked Damian, tilting his head in the direction of the girls.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;Sure! Let&rsquo;s dance you and I first. They&rsquo;re not going anywhere.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;Ok.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>And then suddenly the lights in the club turn off and the music ${appendLinkRowInline('stops', '12c', false)}.</p>

    )

   const row12c = storyRow('12c', `Sexy Boy`, 
`
${storyAudio('night-in-a-secret-world')}
<p>Then flashes of purple, green and yellow lights light the club in pulsating rhythm as the music plays again with a slowly building up beat.</p>
<p>Drew was thrown off guard by the sudden darkness, but Damian hasn't missed a beat, never stopped dancing, as if it was his thing to dance in the dark.</p>
<p>The strobe lights flicker, casting his silhouette in and out of focus, but he remains fluid, his body a living contradiction&mdash;his movements carry a blend of masculine strength and feminine elegance. He starts with a slow, deliberate sway of his hips, rolling them in wide, sensual circles, the motion hypnotic and almost otherworldly to the viewer. His arms are soft, wrists bent delicately as his fingers trail through the air like they're painting invisible patterns.</p>
<p>His steps are light, almost floating above the ground, and every movement is precise, controlled, as though he's performing a ballet on the dance floor. He twirls with a natural finesse, his legs crossing over each other with a dancer's poise, the fabric of his shirt fluttering lightly with each spin. His shoulders pop to the rhythm. His head tilts to the side, eyes half-closed, lost in the rhythm, lips curled into a faint, knowing smile.</p>
<p>His dance is classically elgant, yet so swift, with edge to it. It somehow&nbsp;fits with the techno music and is incomprehencibly intoxicating.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">"Are you a fucking artist?"</span> Drew murmurs, but his voice drowns in the loud noise.</p>
<p>As the beat intensifies, so does his dance. He drops to the ground in a smooth, fluid motion, his knees bending gracefully before he springs back up, his body arching like a bow, then a wave rolls seeml;essly down his body, head to chest, chest to hips, hips to legs. His hands run through his hair, pushing it back in a practiced, almost coy gesture, before his arms extend outward, reaching for Drew, who&nbsp;is too timid to take it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Damian doesn't let Drew slow him down. As the music shifts, he performs a much dirtier, sluttier even, dance.</p>
${chapterStars()}
<p>In the flashes between light and darkness, Damian in front of him was indistinguishable from an exotic dancer. In that enchanting atmosphere, Drew was caught in a trance. He was captivated by Damian&rsquo;s seductive, dirty dancing. Maybe he was too drunk to notice he was a boy anymore, or maybe he was too drunk to have any reservations and released himself to the attractions of good feeling. Drew felt good.</p>
<p>Damian&nbsp;presses&nbsp;himself against Drew. His&nbsp;shoulders sway in slow, deliberate circles, grinding against Drew's strong chest with a teasing intensity that sends a shock through both of them. Damian arched his back, pushing his&nbsp;butt into Drew's lap, feeling the heat of his body through the thin fabric of their clothes. Every movement is intentional, every roll of his hips designed to draw Drew deeper into his rhythm. Drew is fixed like a log.</p>
<p>Damian's hands snake up behind him, fingers tangling in Drew's hair as he pulls him closer, They descend down Drew's neck and carress it. Frustrated with Drew's idleness, Damian presses his back harder, and his movements become more insistent, grinding against Drew with a slow, dirty rhythm until he feels Drew&rsquo;s bulge hardening in his pants, thudding against his tailbone. Damian shivers&nbsp;as he feels Drew&rsquo;s fingers sliding under his shirt feeling his smooth, soft, tummy.&nbsp;His hands slide&nbsp;down Damian's&nbsp;sides, tracing the curve of his waist, the touch quite possessive and invasive. Drew, in his trance, wasn&rsquo;t fully aware of what he was doing.</p>
<p>When your ego is broken you, you are set free from many things that were holding you back.</p>
<p>Your brain goes on a masochistic high until it adjusts. You are carnal until you rebuild your ego again. That&rsquo;s why you can&rsquo;t stop your hands and knees from shaking, because you&rsquo;re not used to things being so real.</p>
<p>There is serenity after turbulence. First you were eager, then you were obsessed, then you were cucked.</p>
<p>You are high as fuck. Drew was high on his release from his life-long obsession with Jaime. The nerves in his ears, his skin, the wires in his brain were unlocked to accept pleasure from other sources. Other than his blurry vision, his senses were heightened. He could feel the music and the touch and taste of Damian&rsquo;s skin as if he hadn&rsquo;t felt for a long time&nbsp;<br>but had only been fantasizing about feeling.</p>
<p>This pleasure coursing through him was unfamiliar yet satisfyingly real.</p>
<p>Drew didn&rsquo;t know what he was doing. He would have not allowed himself to feel up a boy so sensually. But in the sensfulness temporarily filling his hollow ego, it felt good to grind the itch in his cock against Damian&rsquo;s tailbone. It felt good to grasp his neck and it felt extremely good to kiss it on the back.</p>
<p>And then it was as if fireworks were shot in Damian&rsquo;s brain.&nbsp;He teases Drew, pulling away just enough to create space. Drew desperately follows, his body folding to contain Damian as his hands wrap him, just as Damian slides back against him with a force that&nbsp;rocks them both. Drew wraps him tight but Damian, a fleeting pleasure, slides down his arms, his hips rolling in a figure 8 as Drew's bulge massages accross his back. Drew siezes him by his hair and pulls him to his feet. Damian slides his way up, pressed up against Drew, shrugs, yielding to Drew. Drew hooks him by the leghole of his shorts and makes sure they're inseperable. Drawn by Damian's rhythm, he thrusts against him, their hips moving synchronously. Drew's hand unconsciously seeks groping between Damian's legs.&nbsp;Damian tenses up and his hand immediately blocks Drew. Drew&nbsp;kisses the back of Damian's neck, the heat of his breath lingering on Damian's skin. Damian loosens up at Drew's touch but&nbsp;protects what's between his legs as if it was the most precious thing in the world. Drew's desire boils.</p>
<p>Their dance becomes a game, a push and pull of dominance and submission, Damian clearly outdoing Drew in seductive display.&nbsp;The crowd around them fades into the background, the music and lights all but forgotten as they lose themselves in the physicality of their connection. Every grind, every thrust is a silent communication, a conversation spoken in the language of bodies rather than words.</p>
<p>The beat changed to a new song, Drew and Damian were no longer shadows in the flickering lights of the nightclub. The light had uniformed again and they were now exposed to everyone around them, who distanced themselves from the couple in disgust.</p>
<p>As the song reaches its climax, so too does their dance. Damian turns to face Drew, his body still pressed tightly against Drew's, his eyes locking with Drew's in a challenging gaze. He straddles Drew's thigh and grinds it sensually with his hand still between his legs, forbidding Drew any touch with his genitals. The song ends, the lights restore consistency, and they're still in their own world.</p>
<p>A guy suddenly approaches them and shouts. <strong>&ldquo;What the FUCK are you doing, faggots?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;What the fuck did you just call him?&rdquo;</span> Drew roared back at him, seeing Damian&rsquo;s face fall. The guy hesitated, intimidated by Drew&rsquo;s rage, but Drew attacked anyway.</p>
<p>Without warning, Drew choked the man and swept his legs out from underneath him, raining punches on his face.</p>
<p>A group of men immediately jumped in to attack Drew. One of them tried to knee him in the ribs while he was on top of their friend, but Drew parried with his forearm, tackled the attacker down and fucked his face up as well.</p>
<p>The music stopped and the screams of the girls filled the air as Drew continued to fight off every man that came at him until the bouncer and two others cuffed Drew and pulled him out of the club.</p>

<p>Malik kicked Drew and Damian out of the club. <span class="PAF-Malik">&ldquo;The boss won&rsquo;t be happy,&rdquo;</span> He muttered, shaking his head.</p>
<p>Drew shrugged and asked for drinks.</p>
<p>They sat in a dark alley next to the club. Damian lit a cigarette, offered one to Drew.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;You smoke?&rdquo;</span> Drew asked.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been smoking since I was a fetus, I think,&rdquo;</span> Damian replied.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;Bad mother?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;Lovely woman.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>By the time they finished their cigarettes, the bouncer had returned with four bottles of beer. Damian thanked him heartily, but Malik&rsquo;s response was a cold shoulder as he walked away.</p>
<p>Damian took a sip of his beer. <span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;So, what are we gonna do now?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Drew scoffed and downed the rest of his beer in one go before tossing the bottle aside.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;Just sit back and enjoy the view,&rdquo;</span> he replied lazily, while sprawling out on the ground. He stared at the clear night sky before him.</p>
<p>They sat in silence for a while until Damian broke it. <span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;So...&rdquo;</span> he trailed off.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m horny as hell right now,&rdquo;</span> He stated bluntly, taking another sip from his bottle.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m horny too.&rdquo;</span> Drew replied. <span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;Wanna go get some women?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>He gazed at Damian with a serious look on his face.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;I can take you to a brothel,&rdquo;</span> Drew said nonchalantly.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;(chuckling) I knew it! You&rsquo;re exactly the kind of guy who&rsquo;d know where a brothel is. Criminallllll!&rdquo;</span> Damian laughed excitedly.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re in or what?&rdquo;</span> Drew insisted.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;N-no... whores turn me off.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;Why? Are you gay or something?&rdquo;</span> Drew asked dissmissively, earning a laugh from Damian.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;Jeez, no! I like women too... sometimes,&rdquo;</span> Damian clarified awkwardly.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo;</span> Drew snickered.<span class="PAF-Drew"> &ldquo;So why do you dress like a girl? And why were you caught kissing a boy at school?&rdquo;</span> he prodded relentlessly.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s complicated,&rdquo;</span> Damian sighed. <span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;I just like dressing femininely and sometimes I like kissing boys. But that doesn&rsquo;t make me gay.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;Do you suck cock?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;Well...I mean&hellip;Yes, I do like sucking cock,&rdquo;</span> Damian admitted sheepishly.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re a proud cocksucker but you&rsquo;re not gay,&rdquo;</span> Drew said sarcastically.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re only gay if you want to fuck with men. I don&rsquo;t wanna go anywhere near a man&rsquo;s asshole and I don&rsquo;t want anyone to touch mine, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re a cocksucker,&rdquo;</span> Drew prodded relentlessly.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;Why are you so cruel?&rdquo;</span> Damian suddenly snapped, jumping on top of Drew and gripping his shirt tightly in anger.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;Do you think I wanted be like this?</span></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Do you think I wanted to be forced to dress like a girl as a child, locked in chsatity cages before my dick even grew full length, taught to worship my stepfather&rsquo;s big black cock, suck strangers for money?</span></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Think I wanted that?</span></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">Huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">HUH?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Damian&rsquo;s scream pierced the air, yet Drew lay motionless, his arm behind his head, staring coldly at the boy siting on top of him.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you. If you hate gay people so much. Why did you touch me and kiss me so-&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to. I was thinking of someone else,&rdquo;</span> Drew whispered.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;It's ok. I understand that. I relate to that.&nbsp;Did she&nbsp;hurt you?&rdquo;</span> Damian questioned softly. <span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;Is that why you want to run away?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Drew didn&rsquo;t answer.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;C-Can I ask you a favor before you go, Drew?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;...&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;Take me with you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;...&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;Why not? I&rsquo;m just like you. You&rsquo;re hurt, I&rsquo;m broken too. I want to run away too. Don&rsquo;t you think we&rsquo;re the same? Don&rsquo;t you think I want to burn my house, burn that goddamn school and burn this whole damn town and run away? Don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;ve been looking for someone like you for a long time? You know? I&rsquo;ve- I&rsquo;ve never gotten out of my house like this before! But I knew I&rsquo;d be safe around you and I finally did it. I need you, Drew. I need someone like you to protect me.</span></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">I&rsquo;ll be your friend, your companion, I&rsquo;ll learn to understand you. I could be your whore too if you want. I&rsquo;ll do anything to be around you. I never felt so safe around anybody. Never loved so much.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;...&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;But I love you! There I said it!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not straight, Drew. I&rsquo;m not gay or a sissy or a cocksucker. I don&rsquo;t belong to any of those labels. I&rsquo;m on the outside.</span></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">I&rsquo;m just&hellip; a boy, you know?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>His voice quivered with pain.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;I wish I wasn&rsquo;t. I would have had it easier otherwise. I wish I were nothing.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="PAF-Damian">&ldquo;Can you please do me a favor, Drew?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Drew sat up slowly, until their faces were only inches apart. He opened his mouth and involuntarily tasted the salt in Damian's tears on his lips.</p>
<p><span class="PAF-Drew">&ldquo;Damian, I&rsquo;m not running away. It was just a fleeting thought.&rdquo;</span></p>
